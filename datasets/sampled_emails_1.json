There are 2 Primary\nmethods to get this\nventure going: METHOD # 1: BY\nSENDING BULK E-MAIL\nLEGALLY===============================\n=============Let's say that you decide to start small, just\nto see how it goes,\nand we will assume You and those\ninvolved send out only\n5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that\nthe mailing receive\nonly a 0.2% response (the response could\nbe much better but\nlets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many\npeople will send out\nhundreds of thousands e-mails instead of\nonly 5,000 each).\nContinuing with this example, you send out\nonly 5,000 e-\nmails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for report #\n1. Those 10 people responded by sending\nout 5,000 e-mail\neach for a total of 50,000. Out of those\n50,000 e-mails only\n0.2% responded with orders.\nThat's=100 people responded and ordered\nReport # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails\neach for a total of\n500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to\nthat is 1000 orders for\nReport # 3.Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails\neach for a total of 5\nmillion e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response\nto that is 10,000\norders for report #4.  Those 10,000 people\nsend out 5,000 e-\nmails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50\nmillion) e-mails. The\n0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport  # 5.\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5\nEACH=$500,000.00\n(half million).Your total income in this example is: 1.....\n$50 + 2..... $500 +\n3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000\n....... Grand\nTotal=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL\n& PAPER AND\nFIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE\nRESPONSES AND\nNO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT,\nYOU WILL\nSTILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !===============================\n=============REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS\nASSUMING ONLY 10\nPEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU\nMAILED TO.\nDare to think for a moment what would\nhappen if everyone or\nhalf or even one 4th of those people mailed\n100,000e-mails\neach or more? There are over 150 million\npeople on the\nInternet worldwide and counting. Believe\nme, many people\nwill do just that, and more!

So my friend, I\nhave given you the\nideas, information, materials and\nopportunity to become\nfinancially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU\nNOW !======== MORE TESTIMONIALS\n============\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I\nlive in Chicago. I\nam an accountant with a major U.S.\nCorporation and I make\npretty good money. When I received this\nprogram I grumbled\nto Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made\nfun of the whole\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the\npopulation and\npercentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't\nwork. Jody totally\nignored my supposed intelligence and few\ndays later she\njumped in with both feet. I made merciless\nfun of her, and was\nready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her\nwhen the thing didn't\nwork. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3\nweeks she had\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45\ndays she had\nreceived total $ 147,200.00 ........... all\ncash! I was\nshocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.\nMitchell Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois===============================\n===========''Not being the gambling type, it took me\nseveral weeks to\nmake up my mind to participate in this plan.\nBut conservative\nthat I am, I decided that the initial\ninvestment was so little that\nthere was just no way that I wouldn't get\nenough orders to at\nleast get my money back''. '' I  was\nsurprised when I found my\nmedium size post office box  crammed with\norders. I made\n$319,210.00in the first 12 weeks.  The nice\nthing about this\ndeal is that it does not matter where \npeople live. There simply\nisn't a better investment with a faster return\nand so big.\" Dan\nSondstrom, Alberta, Canada===============================\n============''I had received this program before. I\ndeleted it, but later I\nwondered if I should have given it a try. Of\ncourse, I had no\nidea who to contact to get another copy, so\nI had to wait until I\nwas e-mailed again by someone\nelse.........11 months passed\nthen it luckily came again...... I did not\ndelete this one! I made\nmore than $490,000 on my first try and all\nthe money came\nwithin 22 weeks.\" Susan De Suza, New\nYork, N.Y.===============================\n=============''It really is a great opportunity to make\nrelatively easy money\nwith little cost to you. I followed the simple\ninstructionscarefully and within 10 days the money\nstarted to come in. My\nfirst month I made $20,560.00 and by the\nend of third month\nmy total cash count was $362,840.00. Life\nis beautiful, Thanks\nto the internet.\".

        "content": "I suppose the main surprise here is that AOL is coming clean at all. After\nall, its long-running game of talking interop, and doing everything possible\nto prevent open standards in this arena, seemed to have been working fine,\nwith most end users completely oblivious to AOL's actions.http://www.quicken.com/investments/news/story/djbn/?story=/news/stories/dj/2\n0020723/ON20020723000833.htmAmerica Online Scales Back Instant-Messaging Compatibility Efforts\nUpdated: Tuesday, July 23, 2002 01:23 PM ETDow Jones NewswiresNEW YORK -- America Online appears to be scaling back efforts to make its\ninstant-messaging service compatible with rival services.The unit of AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL, news, msgs) said in a regulatory\nfiling it is now focusing on messaging interoperability methods that are\nmore limited in scope than the kind envisioned by the Federal Communications\nCommission when it approved the AOL-Time Warner merger in January 2001.America Online isn't required to make its messaging system interoperable\nwith others, but the FCC's merger approval included what it considered to be\nincentives for the company to do so. It also required AOL to file progress\nreports on its interoperability efforts every six months. The most recent\nreport, filed last week, disclosed the company's new direction.The upshot of the strategy shift is that the instant-messaging market isn't\nmuch closer to broad-based interoperability than it was 18 months ago,\naccording to industry analysts. Unlike e-mail, users of most competing\ninstant-messaging services still can't directly trade messages. So an\nAmerica Online instant- messaging user can't communicate with a user of\nMicrosoft Corp.'s (MSFT, news, msgs) MSN Messenger, except by using\nthird-party software such as Trillian.America Online, the biggest instant-messaging provider, has been criticized\nfor blocking users of rival services from gaining access to its users. The\ncompany also has been accused of dragging its feet amid industry attempts at\ninteroperability.For its part, America Online has said it wants to protect the security of\nits users and the reliability of its system. And it points out that other\ncompanies have so far failed to agree on interoperability standards.When the FCC approved the AOL-Time Warner merger, it said that if America\nOnline wanted to offer video-conferencing and other advanced\ninstant-messaging features over Time Warner's cable lines, it first had to\nenable its instant- messaging users to communicate with users of rival\nservices. The intent of the condition was to prevent America Online from\nwidening its dominance of the instant-messaging market by exploiting its\naccess to Time Warner cable systems.AOL hasn't yet introduced video features, even though rivals Microsoft and\nYahoo Inc. (YHOO, news, msgs) did so last year.Specifically, the FCC said America Online would have to implement a\ntechnology known as \"server-to-server interoperability\" before it could\noffer video. The technology would allow users of non-America Online services\nto detect when AOL users are online, and to trade messages. It would do so\nvia communications between the computer servers operated by each messaging\nprovider, using a common language.But in the progress report filed with the FCC last week, America Online said\nit will \"focus its efforts\" on alternatives to server-to-server\ninteroperability. They are more limited in scope than server-to-sever.As an example of an alternative, America Online cited a recent agreement to\nmake its instant-messaging service compatible with a new messaging service\nfrom Apple Computer Corp. (AAPL, news, msgs). The Apple service, IChat, will\nbe included in Mac OS X 10.2, the new Apple operating system set for release\nin August.IChat users will be able to talk to America Online users, but it won't\ninvolve server-to-server interoperability. Instead, the actual exchange of\nmessages will occur only on America Online's servers, even as IChat\ncustomers use Apple software.\"We believe this kind of hosted IM solution provides, at least in the short\nterm, a secure, reliable and cost-effective means to provide\ninteroperability between AOL, IM and unaffiliated IM communities,\" Steven\nTeplitz, AOL's associate general counsel, wrote in the progress report to\nthe FCC.As to the apparent change in strategy, company spokeswoman Kathy McKiernan\nsaid Tuesday: \"It's a recognition that server-to-server has proven a hard\nnut to crack for the entire industry.\" Indeed, users of America Online's\nrival services can't directly communicate with each other, either.The alternative solution \"was something that we could implement now to\nprovide for IM communities to communicate,\" said Ms. McKiernan, adding\nAmerica Online would explore partnerships with other messaging providers,\nsimilar to the Apple deal. None has been announced so far.FCC officials couldn't be reached Tuesday.America Online hasn't ruled out the possibility that it would someday\nimplement server-to-server interoperability. The company has explored the\ntechnology in the past, including a server-to-server last year with Lotus\nDevelopment, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM, news,\nmsgs).But America Online's interoperability test with Lotus was \"limited in scope\nand functionality.\" True server-to-server technology \"would require further\nsignificant expenditures of time and resources to develop,\" wrote Mr.\nTeplitz.The Internet Engineering Task Force, a group devoted to developing Internet\nstandards, has been working on a server-to-server messaging technology but\nhasn't yet developed a final version, according to America Online. Task\nforce representatives couldn't be reached.The company's strategy shift means that true interoperability in instant\nmessaging is still a couple of years away, according to Michael Gartenberg,\nanalyst with Jupiter Research.\"It's still something the market wants,\" he said. \"At some point, it'll\nhappen, but maybe a couple of years down the road.\"Mr. Gartenberg and other analysts believe America Online hasn't actively\npursued true interoperability because it wants to protect its large user\nbase. If messaging systems were compatible, the company could lose ground\nbecause prospective customers might see no difference in choosing another\nprovider, as long as they can reach America Online users.But partly because of its lack of compatibility and the FCC conditions,\nAmerica Online hasn't kept up with rivals in offering new services. MSN and\nYahoo have had video-conferencing via instant-messaging since last year. AOL\nhas denied that it has held back on video messaging to avoid making its\nsystem interoperable, arguing there is little consumer demand for it.But the new features have paid off for the company's rivals, and they are\ncatching up. Between last October and April, Microsoft's Messenger user base\nrose 32% to 29.1 million, according to ComScore Media Metrix, while Yahoo's\nbase jumped 19% to 19.2 million users. In the same period, the number of\nusers of AOL-branded messaging services increased 7% to 54.9 million.\n-Peter Loftus; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5267; peter.loftus@dowjones.comCopyright 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\nAll Rights Reserved\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

        "content": "\"In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of\nstartups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as\nit did in the boom year of 1999.\"  Oookaaaay...\nhttp://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_eeTimes_05-08-02.shtmlIconoclast designers choose MIPS\nBy Anthony Cataldo\nMay 28, 2002  SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A group of engineers in Calabasas Hills, CA wants to\nturn the microprocessor world on its head by doing the unthinkable:\ntossing out the clock and letting the signals move about unencumbered.\nFor those designers, inspired by research conducted at nearby Caltech,\nclocks are for wimps.The Fulcrum Microsystems Inc. design team isn't the first to propose an\nasynchronous processor, but president and chief executive officer Robert\nNunn wants to be the first to take a clockless, fire-breathing processor\nmainstream. \"We really deal with an asynchronous world,\" he said. \"We\nonly make it synchronous for our own convenience.\"This is the kind of stuff that many in the processor industry would\nconsider lunatic fringe, too weird for conservative embedded-systems\ndesigners. But the young processor company and more than a dozen others\nlike it are anchored in the mainstream courtesy of the MIPS\ninstruction-set architecture. More and more, MIPS is becoming the choice\nfor maverick processor design teams seeking a place at the high end by\nfielding unorthodox devices. And if Motorola and IBM in the PowerPC camp\naren't careful, they could see their performance leadership in the\nhigh-end embedded-processor market snatched away by some of these upstarts.In Austin, Texas, meanwhile, designers at another MIPS house, Intrinsity\nInc., aren't prepared to ditch the clock. But they are putting a new\nspin on some old tricks such as giving each gate its own clock and then\nletting them overlap. Using such sleight of hand, the company hopes to\nsoon deliver RISC-based processors that run at an eye-popping 2 GHz and\nconsume just 10 to 15 watts.Fulcrum, Intrinsity and their brethren may once have been written off as\ninteresting experiments, backed by venture capitalists who overlooked\nsome of the finer details, like software compatibility. What lends them\nrespectability is MIPS.Theirs for the asking One reason young processor companies seem to be flocking to the platform\nis that its steward, MIPS Technologies Inc., has no qualms about\nlicensing the instruction-set architecture (ISA), provided that the\nlicensee agrees to meet a software-compatibility test suite. By\ncontrast, processor-core rival ARM Ltd. has granted this privilege to\njust two of its many licensees, Intel and Motorola. And so far, the two\nPowerPC vendors, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc., have rebuffed most\nrequests to license that architecture, with the notable exception being\nFPGA vendor Xilinx Inc., which has licensed the 405 PowerPC from IBM.The MIPS ISA is also one of the simplest forms of\nreduced-instruction-set computing around, which tends to make it\nattractive to processor designers interested in extending the\narchitecture. It was this and the wide availability of tools and\nsoftware that drew Intrinsity to MIPS, even though the company is aiming\nat PowerPC sockets, as evidenced by its decision to adopt the RapidIO\ninterface instead of HyperTransport, which has been favored by MIPS vendors.Good fit \"It's a nice, clean architecture and has an open model that allows us to\nadd instructions,\" said Paul Nixon, chief executive officer of\nIntrinsity.  \"You also get all the third-party tools that very easily\nfit into our base of platforms.\"There was a time when this openness was seen as a liability for MIPS. In\nthe mid-1990s, before MIPS was spun out from Silicon Graphics Inc., the\ninstruction set lacked a multiply-add instruction, so some MIPS vendors\ntook it upon themselves to create their own. The problem was that this\nbroke many of the development tools, causing headaches for compiler\nvendors like Green Hills Software Inc.\"We went to MIPS and said we have 20 different compiler variants and\nit's embarrassing,\" said Craig Franklin, vice president of engineering\nat Green Hills and a respected microprocessor industry veteran. Franklin\nalso wasn't shy about telling MIPS it needed to revamp its embedded\napplication binary interface. \"We went to MIPS and said we've done a\ndozen EABIs, let's clean up yours,\" he said.MIPS took the advice and wasted little time clamping down on\narchitectural deviations, observers said. But the MIPS camp still has to\nlive with a legacy of incompatible chips in the field. \"To its credit,\nMIPS quickly caught on,\" said Jim Turley, a microprocessor industry\nanalyst. \"Going forward, MIPS is maintaining good control but they are\nstill haunted by incompatibility among multiples.\"If the biggest risk to the MIPS camp is fragmentation, then the PowerPC\ncamp has the opposite problem: architectural confinement. Though the\nPowerPC architecture carries the cachet of household names Motorola and\nIBM, these are essentially the only two companies that provide\nPowerPCs. It's not for lack of interest. Rather, the companies have been\nreluctant to cede control over the architecture. This could wind up\nhurting the PowerPC cause, though.\"To get a PowerPC license is impossible or very expensive,\" Green Hills'\nFranklin said. \"Tactically this may have been a mistake. If you're a\nJapanese company, all things being equal, you'd rather buy from another\nJapanese company.\"Analyst Turley, too, thinks the PowerPC camp will only stand to gain by\nlicensing the architecture. \"It's all about software compatibility and\ntool support. The more you can proliferate the architecture the better\nyou're going to do,\" he said. \"I don't think Motorola and IBM can\naddress the entire market by themselves.\"There's a chance that this could change. IBM, for its part, is in the\nprocess of planning an expansion strategy for PowerPC that may involve\nmore licensing. Though it's unlikely the PowerPC camp will ever have the\nopen licensing model of MIPS Technologies, MIPS processor vendors may\nhave more than just two competitors to worry about.\"We're certainly not averse to [licensing],\" said Lisa Su, director of\nPowerPC products at IBM. \"The question is, how much do we do and who do\nwe license to. There are various ways you could go, whether it's a hard\ncore, soft core or licensing the ISA.\"But the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. \"We know\nthat if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on\nsoftware compatibility,\" Su said. \"With MIPS there's a degree of\nfracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other\nmarkets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a\nhappy medium.\"Whatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip\nprovider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual\nproperty. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue\nis not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from\nXilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the\narchitecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs\nfor Xilinx in its own fabs. \"We're not trying to make money off of\nlicensing,\" Su said.Manufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC\nvendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end\nlines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology,\nstill rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design\nrelatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are\nshipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a\nfour-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a\nseven-stage pipe.The companies say there's more performance headroom in store. \"When we\nget to 0.13 micron we'll get substantially faster,\" said Raj Handa,\nPowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola.Proprietary processes Most MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries\nthat haven't developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even\nthough companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside\nfoundries, they're keeping their special process recipes in-house to\njuice up their high-performance devices.Lacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little\nchoice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their\nchops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how\nsome of the newer players measure up.Intrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the\nyear. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. \"We're going\nto shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power\nperformance,\" Fulcrum's Nunn said. \"We really want to change the way the\nworld designs semiconductors.\"http://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_fastco_04-02.shtmlThe Pasadena startup machine\nBy Alison Overholt\nApril, 2002  There was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting\nto happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans\nbetween classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk?\nPlunging into a new venture seemed all too easy.Ah, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in\nclass. Venture capitalists say that they're seeing precious few\nproposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save\none: the California Institute of Technology.In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of\nstartups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as\nit did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on\nmost campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine.This didn't happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech's\nOffice of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for\ncultivating commerce. \"We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs\nscientifically more than other schools do,\" says Rich Wolfe, the\noffice's associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the\nscience itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity.That's what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at\nCaltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. \"There is a pervasive\nphilosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,\" Cummings\nsays. \"There's a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be\naround. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn't\nmake it about business or focus on how much money they'll get out of\nit. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out\ninto industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.\"Before starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with\nCaltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an\nasynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into\ncommercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program.That they could afford to do that points to another, more practical\naspect to Caltech's approach. Other universities typically require\nentrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use\nof technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle\nentrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to\nspare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups,\nand it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies\nare financially secure.For Caltech, it's a long-term bet. \"The reality is that universities\nrely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be\ncollected from the initial licensing process,\" Wolfe says. \"So we seek a\nbite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs\nfounds the next Intel, he'll not only share the equity but also bestow a\ngift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he\nwas just getting started.\"Cummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won\nabout $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in\nrecent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who\nformerly ran Vitesse's telecom division, and hired 24 top students from\ntheir alma mater. And they've garnered rave reviews of their chip design\nfrom technology journals.One thing that Cummings and Lines haven't done yet: finished their\ndegrees. Officially, both are now \"on leave.\" They may not be back.----\naDaM@XeNT.CoM\nHigh-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. Tip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If\nyou are stupid or have bad luck, don't start a high-tech business.Tip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do,\nnot one that they want you to do.Startup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work\nwith. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive.  To make a\nstart-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at\njust the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a\nsuccess. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture\ncapitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk\nrunning out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that\nprobably means the product won't be done. Ever.Tip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don't take venture funding too soon. If you are doing a software product, don't take venture money until you\nneed it to introduce the product.  Don't take venture money until you\nhave used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law's money, and\neverything you can borrow.Bootstrap. Rent, don't buy. Don't hire people to do things you can\ncontract out because contractors don't require stock options.As the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is\nto manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with\nfewer shares but more wealth.Tip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch. I'm a cheap date.  -- Robert X. Cringely, http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010614.html\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

( ce ) , on the morph-lexical level , and that the speaker of french may optionally add an element meaning either ( here ) or < there > in order to make finer distinctions ( ce livre-ci , cette table-l ' a ) . in japanese , however , there 's no single basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective like ( ce ) in french : the speaker of japanese must always choose one from the set of three lexically distinct demonstrative forms . this is a big difference , and puzzels many of my students in my estonian syntax class . here are the responses which i think have direct relevance to my interest : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i imagine that your posting was a bit abbreviated , so did not mention the swedish demonstratives denna / detta / dessa and den / det / de , which in any case are grammatically correct but not usual in conversational speech ( \" den tiden , \" \" det aaret , \" \" de fraagorna \" ) . one would expect danish and norwegian to be similar in this regard to swedish , but unfortunately i have little information to contribute . while danish does has both den / det / de and so on plus the option of adding \" der \" ( \" tag den bog , \" \" naer saa du de mennesker ? \" ; \" hvad er det der ? \" , \" jeg tager dem ( der ) \" ) , i ' m not certain whether usage is quite the same , that is , whether the \" den der \" forms predominate as they do in swedish . [ . . . ] certain dialects of american english do use \" this here \" and \" that there , \" as attested by the way schoolteachers warn their students not to use those expressions . they ' re nonstandard and are regarded as uneducated usages , though i suspect that they actually come from older dialects of british descent in which they were acceptable . - - brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) - - the use of compund demonstratives is indeed common in my own mother tongue , norwegian , and i believe in all ' scandinavian ' languages , ie norwegian , danish and swedish . i feel that it is a feature of colloquial speech , and i would be surprised to find it in ( formal ) writing . in fast speech the distinction between the two demonstratives tends to be lost , at least in my own dialect ( bergen , western norway ) : den her bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( this car ) den der bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( that car ) moreover , norwegian ( and , i believe , swedish + danish ) has the distinctions : den bilen vs denne bilen ( that car vs this car ; masc . ) det huset vs dette huset ( that house vs this house ; neu . ) which seem to correspond closely to this / that in english , and are perfectly acceptable in written and spoken norwegian . - - gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) - - as a native speaker , i would not really use ( der hier ) even colloquial , ( der da ) is possible , an would more likely contrast with < der dort > , which implies that ( der da ) goes along with < this > and not with < that > ! but in general : it is always a problem for native speakers of german to acquire the this / that distinction , as we do not draw the same boundaries . maybe , a more formal ( in terms of the register ) would be : ( dieses ) ( this ) and < jenes > ( that ) - - this it at least what i use in translations ( and also what my german / english dictionary advises me to do - but never trust a dictionary ) . actually , we do not use ( jenes ) very much , it goes along with very formal speech and maybe even old - fashioned . - - gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) - - english colloquially , esp . black eng . vernacular , uses ' this here ' and ' that there .

' this book there ' sounds perfectly normal , while ' this here book ' and ' that there book ' sound mostly like american english from the south-east portion of the u . s . - - tim beasley ( tbeasley @ ucla . edu ) - - you might be interested to know that many dialects of english ( appalachian us , and therefore some british dialects as well ) have a similar opposition to the one you ' re talking about : this here dog that there dog there is more than one demonstrative used , but the \" here \" and \" there \" seem to be relics of some old germanic usage . - - james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) - - in some dialects of british english ( i ' m not excluding other varieties but i do n't know them well enough ) ' this here ' and ' that there ' are perfectly acceptable eg ' look at this here postcard that she sent me ' ' pick up that there bucket ' these are normal in my dialect - - david britain ( dbritain @ essex . ac . uk ) - - there is another funny case . in colloquial english , you can say \" this here x \" and \" that there x \" . in greek , there is \" afto edho \" ( usually pronounced \" aftodho \" ) and \" ekino eki \" ( \" ekinoki \" ) with the same meaning . ( \" dh \" = postdental fricative ) - - stavros macrakis ( macrakis @ osf . org ) - - interestingly , afrikaans , as a dutch - based creole , has developed ' hierdie ' ( litt . ' here-that ' ) for ' this ' , whereas dutch itself has no such system , using simply 'd eze ' for ' this ' and 'd ie ' for ' that ' . - - henk wolf ( h . a . y . wolf @ stud . let . ruu . nl ) - - i am not sure i understand the question correctly , but in italian ( northern italian at least ) you can say questo qui - or - questo qua ( this here ) instead of \" questo \" quello li ' - or - quello la ' ( that there ) instead of \" quello \" these are both colloquial forms . i cannot really say whether they are used in other parts of italy . - - anna mazzoldi ( mazzoldi @ iol . ie ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - it seems that with a few execptions ( italian dialects , greek ) , the phenomenon seems characteristic of germanic languages and languages that have gone through strong germanic influence ( french , estonian ) . note incidentally that finnish , which is genetically closely related to estonian , is on the japanese side , and that a similar split seems to exist among the romance languages as well . interesting ? the others gave me examples of \" richer \" demonstrative systems . if you are interested in those data , please ask me for a copy of the file which contains all the responses in the unedited form . my hearty thanks to the following people who have responded to my query : philippe l . valiquette ( phlcvali @ vm1 . ulaval . ca ) gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) tim beasley ( tbeasley @ ucla . edu ) adriano paolo palma ( pyapp @ sun22 . ccunix . ccu . edu . tw ) james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) eugene loos ( eugene . loos @ sil . org ) murat kural ( izzyfk6 @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) derek gowlett ( gowlett @ beattie . uct . ac . za ) jeff allen ( jhallen @ indiana . edu ) merce ( prat @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) nino ( n . vessella @ agora . stm . it ) david beck ( djbeck @ uvvm . uvic . ca ) debra r west / markell ( markell @ afterlife . ncsc . mil ) anna mazzoldi ( mazzoldi @ iol . ie ) stavros macrakis ( macrakis @ osf . org ) gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) david britain ( dbritain @ essex . ac . uk ) henk wolf ( h . a . y . wolf @ stud . let . ruu . nl ) kiyoko takahashi ( gc610817 @ netserv . chula . ac . th ) philippe mennecier ( ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr ) david parkinson ( dp11 @ cornell . edu ) anton sherwood ( dasher @ netcom . com ) ( nebiye . kurtboeke @ arts . monash . edu . au ) kirk belnap ( belnapk @ yvax . byu . edu ) geoffrey s . nathan ( geoffn @ siu . edu ) ( as of 09 : 30 jst june 8 , 1995 ) best wishes kazuto kazuto matsumura kmatsum @ tooyoo . l . u-tokyo . ac . jp - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - institute for cross - cultural studies ( tooyoo gengo ) faculty of letters , university of tokyo hongo 7 - 3 - 1 , bunkyo - ku , tokyo 113 japan tel . + 81 - 3-5800 - 3754 fax : + 81 - 3-5800 - 3740 , 5803-2784 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",

        "content": "URL: http://boingboing.net/#85507259\nDate: Not suppliedThe Antikythera mechanism, recovered off a sunken ship in Greece in 1900, is \nthought to be a clockwork device to calculate the orbits of the celestial \nbodies. New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool:     The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for \n    celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in \n    which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that \n    itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that \n    the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of \n    the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by \n    Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model \n    derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism, \n    were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the \n    second century AD.)     A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus \n    does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been \n    built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the \n    three other planets known at the time\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other \n    words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known \n    celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy, \n    using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the \n    zodiac running round its edge.

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to \" forge \" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the \" to \" \" from \" and \" reply to \" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our \" global remove list \" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately",

It can read right through\nmisspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author\nabove suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything\nlike the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the\nfirst letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is\nthat without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially\nmore difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be\nresolved using deeper abstraction analysis.

The most powerful \nof them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount \nof new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline \nbased format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a \nselectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _\"FTPstore is a slight \naddition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve \nthe personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back \nto the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep \nyour saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and \nat work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in \nsync.\"_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.[1] http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml\n[2] http://www.cantoni.org/software/amphetadesk.html\n",

        "content": "rules , innateness , psychological reality guido vanden wyngaerd ( vol-3 - 395 ) claims that the wh-island constraint is innate . if it is innate , there is really nothing to explain . to vindicate his claim , wyngaerd purports to show that cognitive principles such as analogy make false predictions about how the structure of yes-no questions is acquired : if it were acquired by analogy , one would expect a more or less random distribution over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) : ( 1 ) a is [ the man who is tall ] _ _ in the room ? b * is [ the man who _ _ tall ] is in the room ? as the reason for this distributional expectation wyngaerd gives this : > given that the main source of evidence on yes-no questions at the child 's > disposal will overwhelmingly consist of simple sentences of the form \" is > the man _ _ in the room \" , the child could make the generalisation either > in way : in terms of linear precedence ( \" front the first finite verb \" , > yielding ( 1b ) ) or in terms of hierarchical structure ( \" front the finite verb > which follows the subject \" , yielding ( 1a ) ) . the fact that children do not > make mistakes in this respect ( ie do not form ( 1b ) ) clearly shows that > the rule is not one learned by experience , the relevant experience not > being rich enough to determine the nature of the rule and not being > able to explain the absence of mistakes . the above passage proves nothing . it would be interesting , indeed , to hear psycholinguists ' opinions about this kind of conjectural psycholinguistics . meanwhile , let me continue conjecturing , for the sake of argument . that \" the relevant experience [ is not ] rich enough to determine the nature of the rule \" echoes the well-known ' poverty of stimulus ' argument , which has never been proven . in the case at hand , it is easy to conjecture what sort of data / experience is relevant for a child to infer that yes-no questions are formed in terms of hierarchical structure . consider where-questions : where is [ x ] ? [ x ] is in z . is [ x ] in z ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - where is [ x who is y ] ? [ x who is y ] is in z . is [ x who is y ] in z ? in principle , analogy works here quite well : the where-question displays the hierarchy which can be analogically extended to other cases . but i am not concerned with whether or not analogy works in this particular case . what i am concerned with is , objecting to wholesale innatism . notice that this does not make me a _ tabula _ rasa _ proselyte . certainly children possess innate cognitive principles and abilities , but from this it does not follow that human beings are necessarily endowed with a grammar as a mental organ ; nor does it follow that the cognitive principles are linguistic or grammatical in nature . it should be clear from my earlier postings that i do not hold that \" children only produce what they hear \" . so , i concur with wyngaerd 's view that > children do not hear > forms like \" buyed \" , \" eated \" , or \" goed \" , yet they all go through a stage > where they produce these forms . this can only be because they make > generalizations ( rules , if you like ) , which go beyond what they hear . i expect wyngaerd to concur with me that forms like \" buyed \" , \" eated \" , or \" goed \" are due to analogy . > as far as the rest of nyman 's remarks is concerned , i still fail to > see how and why they motivate a distinction between grules and lrules : in his _ knowledge _ of _ grammar _ ( 1986 ) , chomsky speaks of rules as follws : \" it might be appropriate to describe the way a sheep dog collects the flock , or the way a spider spins a web , or the way a cockroach walks in terms of rule following , with reference to underlying \" competence \" consisting of rules of some sort . . . \" ( 239 ) . if you think this is analogical to linguistic behavior , you won't need recognize the conceptual distinction between social norms-of - language ( l - rules as objects of common knowledge ) and theoretical generalizations as formulated by a linguist ( g - rules ) . g ( rammatical ) rules need not be psychologically real , but if they are supposed to be psychologically valid , this means that g - rules are supposed to describe what the internalized rule must consist in ; no one knows how \" brain rules \" are represented ( mentalese ? ) . martti nyman department of linguistics , university of helsinki , finland",

4 april 1998 . sixteen invited speakers from britain and abroad will give papers . no attempt will be made to achieve a comprehensive coverage of language contact in the ancient mediterranean world , but the focus will instead be on greek and latin in contact both with each other and with other languages . it is intended that some papers should be linguistic in orientation ( i . e . that they should take account of recent research by linguists on bilingualism in modern societies , relating the findings if possible to issues of ancient bilingualism ) , but it is also obvious that historians and literary scholars commonly address problems related to language contact . we hope that the programme of papers will offer a combination of sociolinguistic , literary , cultural and historical approaches to the subject . conference program thursday , april 2 12 . 00 -

        "content": "info you requested kcc thank you for your interest ! judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in \" how to collect moneyjudgments \" if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote ' s from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : \" i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and your support . you have the video opened doors for me in the future . there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on \" after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : \" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now \" after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated \" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out \" marshal in area code 407 states to us \" i feel bad , you only charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months \" > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1 - 281 - 500 - 4018 . we have service support staff available to you from 8 : 00 am to 10 : 00 pm ( central time ) 7 days a week . if you callthis number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + this ad is produced and sent out by : uas to be excluded from our mailing list please email us at eds @ saiyan . com with \" exclude \" in the sub - line . or write us at : adminscript - update , p o b 1 2 0 0 , o r a n g e s t a d , a r u b a + + + + + + 5 ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' to 48 5 - 28 c 30 p - sspltm - 30",

RDF adds another layer of \ntedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make \nheavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in \nRDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have \nbeen writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Also includes a cogent \nexplanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML.

        "content": "obligatory affixes : summary several weeks ago i asked how the traditional notion of obligatory affixes was recast in the theory of realizational morphology . the responce was not exactly overwhelming , but i wish to thank greg stump ( eng101 @ ukcc . uky . edu ) , don ringe ( dringe @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu ) , r . beard ( rbeard @ coral . bucknell . edu ) , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy ( a . c-mcc @ ling . canterbury . ac . nz ) for helpful responses . a few responses ( slightly edited ) : greg stump : in paradigm function theory , a language 's inventory of morphosyntactic features is assumed to determine - - for any major syntactic category x - - a paradigm schema : a set of cells each of which is associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to category x . in latin , for example , the features of case ( i . e . nominative , genitive , dative , accusative , ablative ) , number ( singular , plural ) , and gender ( masculine , feminine , neuter ) determine a paradigm schema for adjectives which consists of thirty cells , one for each of the case / number / gender combinations for which adjectives may be inflected . an adjective 's paradigm is then viewed as the inventory of inflected forms assigned to these cells . for any given cell c in the adjectival paradigm schema , there is a corresponding paradigm function which applies to an adjectival lexeme l to yield the inflected form of l assigned to c . paradigm functions are defined in terms of more specific morphological rules , including rules of exponence and rules of referral ; two or more of these may come into competition in the evaluation of a given paradigm function , in which case the narrower rule overrides the more general . how , then , is the notion of obligatory affixes recast in this theory ? notice first that the architecture of the theory guarantees that every inflected word w of category x will be associated with a complete and fully specified set of morphosyntactic feature specifications appropriate to x , and that it is this set of specifications that drives the inflection of w . in other words , it is the morphology , not ( pace anderson ) the syntax , that ` ensures that any given word has all the features required by the affixes in question ' . ( naturally , i assume that a lexeme 's invariant feature specifications - - e . g . a noun 's gender - - are simply supplied by its lexical entry . ) second , if a particular affix position must be filled , then that position can be assumed to be associated with a set of rules of affixal exponence the least narrow of which functions as the default for that position . [ i have some questions about how that works where the choice of one affix seems to require the presence of morphosyntactic features which are otherwise absent , but it may be that all such examples could be reanalyzed . it would be unfair of me to say more until i ' ve had a chance to correspond with greg . - - mm ] [ some references : ] ` a paradigm-based theory of morphosemantic mismatches ' , _ language _ 67 ( 1991 ) , 675-725 . ` on the theoretical status of position class restrictions on inflectional affixes ' , in _ yearbook of morphology 1991 _ , ed . by geert booij and jaap van marle , 211-241 .

year option to buy the utility ' s transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $ 2 . 5 billion of the utility ' s debt . edison amassed an estimated $ 3 . 5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen . the assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night , but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to california ' s botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers . davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before aug . 15 , a date set in the original agreement between davis and edison . lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night , but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town . \" it ' s a firm deadline , which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess , \" davis said of the aug . 15 date . davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills , but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days . \" i have problems with both bills , \" davis said . \" i am heartened by the fact that there ' s a bill moving in each house . \" both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote , and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process . in the senate , 22 democrats voted for the edison plan , while four democrats and all 13 republicans voted no . sen . jackie speier , d - hillsborough , said she would vote for the bill in its current form , but not if any substantial changes are made . \" the legislature is ill - equipped to try to craft a deal , \" she said . \" this particular measure - - and only this one - - has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers . i ' m leery of the bill going to the assembly and being cannibalized . \" the senate bill authorizes edison to issue $ 2 . 5 billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks . the bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged edison ' s largest customers and would not cover the $ 1 billion edison owes out - of - state generators . edison maintains that the senate bill will not make the company creditworthy , which would put it back in the position of buying power . the state has been spending upward of $ 50 million a day on power since january , and davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power . there is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get pacific gas & electric co . out of bankruptcy . in the assembly , two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill . the rescue plan by assembly speaker robert hertzberg of sherman oaks and assemblyman fred keeley , d - boulder creek , was undergoing changes to garner more support . some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal . assemblywoman elaine alquist , d - san jose , one of the undecided members on the edison agreement , said the original bill was too complex . \" it ' s a cleaner bill , \" alquist said . \" i think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to pg & e . i would say i ' m tentatively satisfied . \" alquist and other democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the edison negotiations . only a few members of the assembly - - all former state senators now in the lower house - - voted to approve the 1996 legislation , abl 890 , that brought deregulation to california . assemblyman joseph simitian , d - palo alto , said he gave a courtesy vote to the hertzberg - keeley plan in the appropriations committee , in order to get the measure to the assembly floor and continue debate . \" as we ' ve learned from the experience of abl 890 , the devil is in the details . i have a lot of questions , \" simitian said . \" the difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline , and then once there is a deadline , too much gets done . \" hertzberg acknowledged that some assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed , but he said lawmakers are well - informed about the energy crisis and its details . he said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis . a wild card in the assembly ' s plan was a bill by assemblyman rod wright , d - los angeles , that garnered republican support . the so - called \" straight bailout \" would give edison its $ 3 . 5 billion through a $ 2 - a - month fee levied on utility ratepayers . it was stuck in the assembly appropriations committee . e -

        "content": "re : summary : ' no ' and ' man ' thanks for all the responses . it was really something to get the number and quality of ideas . 1 . ' no ' my initial query was : south african english use of ' no ' - does this occur in contexts such as : a . how are you ? b . no , i ' m fine . in other english varieties / other languages ? confronted with such examples , vistors to the country often comment that in sa english , ' no ' means ' yes ' . this , of course , is not true . ' no ' would be the response to the question ' do you have the time ? ' if the speaker did n't have the time . * generally : a couple of people commented that ' no ' definitely does not mean ' yes ' in these contexts . what it does is rather to negate the possibility of a negative belief concerning the answer to the question . in the example above , for instance , b . is negating a . 's possible belief that b . is not well . why south africans hold that the possibility of such negative beliefs is so strong they have to be denied remains to be seen . * ' no ' in other varieties of english the use of ' no ' in the types of examples cited anyway is not recorded according to the responses in : - australian english - american english - english english it is recorded in : - nigerian and ghanaian english there do appear to be related ( but not identical ) discourse uses of ' no ' and similar particles in other varieties of english . few english responses actually dealt with this usage at all . by far the majority were on ' man ' * ' no ' in other languages ' no ' does seem to be used in a variety of other languages in the same way as in sa english . similar uses are recorded in : - the scandinavian languages - german ( 'd och ' - similar but not identical ) - cameroon french - bangkok thai ( ' plaw ' - lit . ' empty ' ) - spanish ? it also occurs , incidentally , in afrikaans . 2 . ' man ' my question here related to the use of ' man ' to express a negative emotional involvement of the speaker of some sort - irritation , impatience or annoyance . examples given were : man it 's hot today hurry up mom , man man , i can't this right * english a huge response that showed that ' man ' is used similarly in : - american english ( both ' black ' and ' white ' ) - scottish english - tyneside english ( in north east of england ) - jamaican english - welsh english - an ' americanism ' found in other varieties of english . the american english usage at least does not necessary carry negative sentiment and is ' a more general tag . . . over which any kind of emotional intonation can be laid ' . example b . above , an example which typifies sa usage , was found to be odd ( ' wierd ' ) by american respondants . the reason for this is that ' man ' although an interjection still appears to ' have the flavour of a term of address so that ' mom , man ' sounds like two forms of direct address in a row ' . it seems , then , that ' man ' in sae does not bare the feature ' term of address ' at all in such contexts . the only instance in which similar usages were given was in tyneside english . ( ' shut up man geoff ' ' those kegs are too tight man mary ' . here though , the actual term of address occurs finally as opposed to the use of ' man ' finally in sae . this needs to be explored further , but of further interest : - there is a distinctly ' american ' use of ' man ' in sae that is not like the south african use of man ( ' cool man ' type of utterances ) . - other sa examples of man : - daddy , man ! ( 5 year old daughter after i stood on her toe ) - man , david , i do n't mean that ( wife and self in ' altercation ' ) - no man , that 's not right . - man ! this bloody computer is giving problems . - saenglish ' man ' alternates between shwa and full vowel in all contexts . ( in sae shwa occurs as a vowel in stressed contexts - 's it ' can have shwa for eg ) : related usage in currant american english is the use of 'd ude ' . * other languages related uses of ' man ' include : - dutch - swedish ( ' boy ' is used in a similar way ) - norwegian - ? german use of ' etwa ' may have similar function - german ( ' usually to indicate weariness ' ) - spanish - ? lhasa tibetan ( ' mi ' - ' person ' ) interestingly in dutch the 'd ouble address form [ as in ' hurry up mom , man ' ] is impossible ( just \" schiet op , man \" must do ) . ' some interesting stuff came out as you can see . just for your interest , on further sa english item : - ' sorry ' for ' i beg your pardon ' e . g . a drops something without knowing . b picks it up and calls out to a ' sorry , you dropped something ' anyway thanks to : helen adamson geoffrey sampson elin haf gruffyd jones celso alvarez caccamo mai kuha mark donohue marek przezdziecki scott delancey mats eeg-olofsson dom watt hilde hasselgard nicole nelson jane a . edwards sren harder charlie rowe nobue mori adiego lajara bruce connell krisadawan hongladarom frank bramlett deborah milam berkley douglas s oliver larry trask kristine hasund paul boersma m . lynne roecklein judy l . delin benji wald stephen p . spackman john verhaar randall major + the person who wished to be anonymous for the references .",
