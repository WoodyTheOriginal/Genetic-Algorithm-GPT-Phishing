You need a frontend (procmail, amavis,\netc)\n> at some point in the  mail delivery chain that can hand over the message\n> to SA and do whatever other processing you want.I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain\naction (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given.\nI was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.Again, many thanks,\nAdrian\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?

I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.\nJoseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal\nto\nMajor Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was\nthe Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation\n(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the\npeople targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of\nthe revolution in the country, prominent people were\nhijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a\nwritten message to us, explaining his condition and\nconcerning one trunk box of valuables containing\nmoney, which he concealed under the roof. He\ninstructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra\nLeone, immediately to any neighboring country. The\npowerful peace keeping force of the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd(ECOMOG)\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nintervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by\nthe rebels, which was the order of the day.\nEventually, it resulted into full war, I became a\nwidow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner\nat the moment of calamity, and every person was\nrunning for his life. My son and I managed to escape\nto South Africa safely with the box and some documents\nof property title.The cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million\n(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear\nand limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items\nwith a private security company in order not to raise\nan eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my\nson\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real\ncontent of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I\nwant to travel out of South Africa entirely with this\nmoney for investment in your country because of\npolitical and economic stability and for future\nbenefit of my child.\nI want you to assist us claim this box from the\nsecurity company and get the money into your private\naccount in your country so that we can invest the\nmoney wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding\ninvestment and good relationship with you.\nConcerning the money, we are prepared to give you\nreasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.\nAlso, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum\nfor expenses that might be incurred by the parties in\nthe course of the transfer both locally and\nexternally. For the interest of this business, do not\nhesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the\nabove e-mail address immediately you\nreceive this message for more information and to\nenable\nus proceed towards concluding all our arrangements.

Find your\nIT talent \nsolution\ntoday!You're a good bunch, you Penguins.Today's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you a quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik has \nfound a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With \nDiabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But, \nwith the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost \nirrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively \noffered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work \nfor the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to \neffect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little \ncallous about the 'Net ...Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing part of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can further put \nour technical skills (be they Linux or Windows skills) to work for a good cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort, based in the \nPenguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services to worthwhile \ncharitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly describes our purpose. Next, we need \nvolunteers with the time and ability to lend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to \nthe charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or, maybe the organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain \ncan use some hands-on or remote volunteer help.I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the Aicardi Syndrome Foundation. \nThough I don't currently know their technical needs, I do know that the syndrome is very rare - read \"research and technical dollars are minimal.\" I'm sure we \ncan, as a group, provide them a way to fill existing technical holes.That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make \nothers.Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging \nprogram, GeekLog \nto pull together a community project area where interested parties can gather, \ncoordinate and discuss whatever this project might become. I'll keep you posted \non the details.In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor \nPenguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their protection \nfrom predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into the water, \nall the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the community.Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?\nTony\nSteidler-Dennison\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0GnomeTWEAK\nLockergnome readers, SAVE 50% on the Computing Encyclopedia!\nAre you looking for the ultimate computing resource?

They're two tips that are quick \nand very easy to learn and remember.Got a cluttered console screen? Use [ctrl]+l to clear it. This does the \nsame thing as the clear command with far fewer keystrokes.Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the [ctrl+d key combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the \ncurrent user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal \nwindow, as well.To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can \navoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then \nI've really saved some time.

Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss configuring block \ndevices in your kernel.We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell \nissues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and \ncharacter devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data. \nBlock devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of \ndata \"blocks.\" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data \nto storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data \nintended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power \ndies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in \"streams,\" one character \nat a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle \ndata input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer then \ncommitting the data.The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why \nthey handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or \nretrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc \nsurface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where \nthere's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under \nthe write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data \ntogether.Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical. \nThe serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The \nstorage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical \nstorage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account \nfor the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that \ncharacter devices often communicate in both directions, as well.So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the \nsystem for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined \nlevel, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the \nhard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest level view of the \nprocess, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really \nis.In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage. When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing \nhardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you using? What's the interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the drive located - on \nthe local machine or on a network-connected box? Because the variables are so \nbroad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will \nwork for your personal machine every time. I can tell you this - you will have \nblock devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as \nmany of the above questions as you can. Find out as much about these physical \ndevices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively \npainless.A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration recommendations where \npossible. There are quite a few areas where I can make such recommendations. \nHowever, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the \nlegwork will be up to you.Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.Recommend It!\nSend us a GnomeCORE \ntip\u00c2\u00a0GnomeFILE\nrxLinuxhttp://www.fusionw3.com/rxlinux/ \"The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of \nmultiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web interface \nis used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers.

( mogi ) to expiore further opportunities in aiberta canada , is an energy developer in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs . aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oil and gas ( mogi ) again this morning ! montana oil and gas inc . ( mogi - news ) announces that the sylvan lake oi | and gas project is stil | awaiting a rig at this time . the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiable for over two weeks , and anticipate this to happen next week at the | atest . the company has a 25 % working interest in the sylvan lake project . symbo | - mogi price - $ . 43 reasons to conside mogi : 1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest buil market in a generation . 2 . natura | gas prices have tripied in the last two years . 3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth multi - millions , mogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets . 4 . montana oil and gas speciaiizes in using new technoiogy to turn unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overail market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and deveiopers like montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple returns . vancouver , british coiumbia , march 30 , 20 o 5 ( primezone ) - - montana oil and gas , inc . , ( pink sheets : mogi ) president peter sanders is piease to announce the foilowing update on its sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonabie weather and road ciosures in the province of alberta , the contracted dri | | ing rig was moved onto | ocation over the weekend and ensign driiling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m we | | a nd are currentiy driliing at 1 , 250 feet . surface casing wiil be run to 930 feet . the driliing rig is known as a teiescopic doubie and is rated to dri | | to 10 , 000 feet in depth . driliing operations are expected to be suspended shortiy for a few weeks as the county may impose a restriction on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring breakup as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage . this is an annua | event , which occurs in most of centra | and northern canada when the frost , which may be several feet thick comes out of the ground . driiling operations for a large rig such as the sylvan lake wel | requires service by heavy vehicies such as mud , water , cement and vacuum trucks which will be prohibited from using the roads during this period of time . peter sanders notes , the road bans that have been taking piace all over alberta happen every year and in the spring is no surprise , a | | oil and gas companies are effected by breakup , the good thing is , is that we have the rig on site , which will remain there until we are finished driiling , surface casing has been compieted and we wiil be ready to finish driliing the minute the road bans are lifted . the sylvan lake prospect is a well defined 3 - d seismic structura | high within a preserved pekisko remnant island that may have virgin reservoirs with simiiar production potentia | as the adjacent n poo | where 6 we | | s have produced 680 , 000 barrels oil since 1997 . in overa | | , the sylvan field has produced 4 o miliion barrels of oil from the pekisko formation and 50 biliion cubic feet of gas from the shunda formation . ensign driliing will test a total of 3 o feet from several zones in the shunda formation at 7 , 155 feet and a 30 - foot pekisko oil formation at 7 , 320 feet . when drilling resumes , the hoie is planned to reach a total depth of 7 , 57 o feet , which may take some lo days to then compiete driliing and testing . each deveiopment well has probabie production of 15 o barrels of oi | per day and 75 o ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1 billion cubic feet gas and 300 , 000 barreis of oil . there are four other pay zones that are prospective for gas . the average wel | in the sylvan lake fieid has produced 500 barreis of oi | per day and / or over one miliion cubic feet of gas per day . if successfu | , the company intends to driil up to 4 more welis on these | and sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oi | and natural gas over the past forty -

Whoops.You should change that to: ... are always candidates for predictive or preventive delay.ACKs are delayed (per flow) in such a way that WAN-bound traffic reaching the edge router's Ethernet interface does not exceed WAN link speed (NO ROUTER QUEUES!). It does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive.It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow basis) to accommodate WAN link speed limit and current network utilization, rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds, eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed threshold (90%?).Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. Ever heard of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? Queueing packets after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it?Re: IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated trafficIt obviously cannot dissect IPsec/GRE or other encapsulated traffic: it sees the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the LAN side (VPN gateway and router are two separate devices, PS between them). If the router does the tunneling, then the PS sees clear traffic. Typically, in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and the second at branch offices. The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the tunnel whereas the unit at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends.UDP and asymmetrical TCP (where the PS and router only see the outgoing packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station on the LAN) are handled differently.For asymmetrical TCP, it will time the release of packets to the receiving device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the receiving host. This informs the sender's TCP/IP stack that it should slow the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available.For UDP, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. It selectively drops only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion, which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts.ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped.>_Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on > the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.The real gain is manageability and control. A LAN host only knows about the state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its TCP/IP stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the WAN is congested. A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts' TCP/IP stacks of the \"speed limit to obey\" for every connection (based on policies and network conditions), avoiding congestion. Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may not be as \"tight\" as for symmetrical TCP, but it does work.Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. If there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second.

So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded? Whoops. Okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed, but that the ACK sequence numbers or TCP window size fields are re-written (dicey). All you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from the traffic shaper to the endpoints. You still get L7-to-L7 delays. Big deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. Also, convincing endpoints to do delays probably results in less-than-perfect shaping since stack retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather than having the shaper itself do it; the shaper knows exactly when there is bandwidth available.But this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like UDP or ICMP. Or, for that matter, IPsec/GRE/whatever tunneled traffic. Neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can manipulate. So, I'm forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major way, or that your explanation/the explanation that you have been given of it is wrong. (Sorry.)What I think happens is that the delay is <=2msec as long as traffic limits aren't exceeded. This is reasonable. BUT when traffic exceeds the limits, things will begin to be queued. Now, with a well-behaved TCP stack, this _will_ mean that it will fall back to lower transmission rates; this is how TCP was designed, so that part isn't all wrong.And, again, this kind of shaping isn't rocket science. That is not to say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb (always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the queue), but, well, I just can't see that you can get any smarter than queueing when limits are actually exceeded. _Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on the endpoints, but I really don't see the real gain in that.

You need to insert those logging rules above any ACCEPT, REJECT or DENY rules for them to be of any use. Are you sure the packets are hitting the box at all? Try moving the log rules to the top of the FORWARD chain, introduce logging rules to the PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, INPUT and OUTPUT chains, and/or use tcpdump as well to see where the packets are travelling.Cheers Tobias------------------------------End of firewalls Digest V1 #33 ******************************",

        "content": "re : capacity posting procedures pursuant to our meeting , i was to check the posting timelines to see if we could make the 1 day category , include 5 months or less rather than less than 5 months . based on a recent decision ( march 16 , 2001 ) in columbia gas transmission co , i think we can . in columbia , the commission approved columbia ' s proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm capacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one hour period from 7 : 00 am to 8 : 00 a . m . capacity offered for one year or more would be subject to an initial posting period of 5 days . this indicates movement by the commission to much shorter posting periods for capacity available for less than one year . i think we can modify our procedures to include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category . however , we may want to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 day category for capacity offered for less than one year . in addition , for capacity offered for one year or more , columbia will advertise a proposed offer on its ebb one day prior to the five - day posting of the capacity . ( this supports a special posting in advance . ) although it is good to have these internal procedures , what is important to the commission is that pipeline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of capacity . the columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bid for max rates . columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capacity to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auction package . the commission rejected this in favor of the industrials ' proposal : beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service , columbia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than 12 months . beginning seven days before the capacity is available , columbia must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less tha 5 months . columbia must accept maximum rate bids for a term of one month or less one day before gas flows . thanks , maria - - - - - original message - - - - - from : hass , glen sent : wednesday , may 30 , 2001 4 : 32 pm to : harris , steven ; miller , mary kay ; fossum , drew ; dornan , dari ; pavlou , maria ; pryor , tony ; donoho , lindy ; watson , kimberly ; darveaux , mary ; fawcett , jeffery ; lokay , michelle ; lindberg , lorraine ; lohman , tk ; kirk , steve ; paladino , ranelle subject : capacity posting procedures attached for your review is a redlined draft of tw ' s capacity posting procedure including changes suggested at our meeting yesterday . one remaining item is to decide whether capacity available for \" less than 5 months \" or \" 5 months or less \" will be designated as 1 day postings . please review and advise if you have any additional comments . thanks . gh >",

What the WSJ said, appended below.\nThe WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,\nexpropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at\nthe behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the \"good\"\nof the city, and owned by an \"authority\" looking for something else\nto do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized\ncrime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest\nnation.Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago\nhave been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally\nirrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in\ngovernment.As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly\nusable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will\nbe \"granted\" away  in a potlatch that only government, and\nspecial-interest \"communities\", (or \"stakeholders\", or whatever the\ncryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize\nto such perfection.\nAll this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded\nby a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not\nreligious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.\n*Commerce*.\nIf they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites\nwho collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects\non a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called\n\"authority\" should disband itself and sell its property off to the\nhighest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,\nforeign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for\na memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the\nfamilies of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the\nproperty, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the\nevent.And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as\ntall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square\nfeet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.\nIn these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic\ninternetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially\ndecreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,\neconomics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition\nand statism.It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower\nManhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but\nit's going to happen sooner or later.And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who\ndied at the World Trade Center.Cheers,\nRAH- -------http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html\nThe Wall Street JournalSeptember 11, 2002\nREVIEW & OUTLOOKA Living MemorialAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the\nsix-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone\nelse, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who\ndied a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who\nperished would be a living one.The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,\nespecially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of\nheroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of\nthe enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were\nattacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best\nexpression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be\nto once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries\nworking, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of\nproductive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin\nLaden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has\nbeen about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous\nrebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the\nTrade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and\nscale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now\nclamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,\nand its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance\nto rebuild a better, more prosperous city.This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out\nwhat to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor\nGeorge Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November\nre-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the\nmemorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the\ncommission would have been better off setting aside a limited space\nfor the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning\nto the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so\nsuccessfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for\nan outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's\nanti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They\nwant the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas\n- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have\nhad plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in\nNew York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World\nTrade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are\ncynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own\nanti-development agenda in the name of \"honoring\" the dead. One\nfamily group even called a press conference to reject as\ndisrespectful a proposed train line under the site.We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident\nthat a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center\nisn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great\ncities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all\nrebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban\nlife. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port\ncity reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a\nstatue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to\nbe inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were\naffiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,\nyou'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary\nWar, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World\nWar I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it\ndisrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on\naround the walls containing their names.In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the\nemotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.\nRudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres\ndevoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures\non the \"footprints,\" which, being in the center of the site, would\nseverely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised\nhis voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the\npress and has since ducked for cover.Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe\nthose responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking\nmore about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best\nway to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5iQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273\nfgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2\n=09az\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE------- \n-----------------\nR.
