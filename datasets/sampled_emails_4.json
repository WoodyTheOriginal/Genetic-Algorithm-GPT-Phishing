        "content": "re : 5 . 1500 comparative method , polarization & reviews i am forwarding the following for posting at the request of robert rankin ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . unkans . edu ) . i do not subscribe to this list and have no wish to join the fray at present , but when my name is mentioned sometimes the file is forwarded to me via e-mail . thus the following : andy anderson cites me on three points in a series of recent postings . i have known andy upwards of 30 years and do not feel that he would in - tentionally misrepresent my views , but i also feel a couple of things need clarification . first , i am uncomfortable about being formally cited as a ( secondary ) source of information on lyle campbell 's paper from the boulder ( green - berg ) conference of ca . 1990 . if andy wishes to distribute an attack on the paper or its author in written form , he should first obtain an actual copy of it or , alternatively , await its publication . i guess i should n't have brought it up in our conversation at the ssila / aaa meetings . second , i am said to have reported that the geneticists who have studied the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) of sundry native american and siberian peo - ples claim that there were / are \" two subgroups within amerind ( aside from the eskimo and athabaskans ) . \" this is not what i ( or the paper 's authors wallace , torroni and schurr , et al . ) said . the authors did not address themselves to the linguistic problems and most certainly did n't talk about \" subgroups \" . nor did i , since i do not regard the historicity of anything like \" amerind \" as even remotely established . the authors of the paper did posit at least four \" migrations \" . they do not discuss the most recent , eskomo - aleut , in their abstract , but i think they gave a time depth figure of about 6000 years bp ( before present ) for it orally - - do n't quote me . from their abstract : for what they call na - dene their figure is 7000-10000 years bp . then they say they have evidence for at least two \" migrations \" preceding that . one comes between 12000-15000 bp and the earliest between 26000-34000 bp . figures as high as 40000 bp were mentioned orally , as i recall . they did not attempt to correlate their figures with our knowledge of periods of glaciation or the periodic existence of the land bridge in beringia . i leave it to readers to decide what this portends for the amerind hypo - thesis or its proposed ( glotto ) chronology , but a warning is in order in any event . note that i have written \" migration \" in quotes above . this is not because i wish to pejorate the term ; it is because geneticists use it in a very special way . for them it has to do solely with the ap - pearance of specific genetic material in american populations . they then assume a common ancestor and calculate the number of millennia by positing a uniform mutation rate for mtdna . the material and theories they work with force this definition of migration on them . all this says nothing about the situation \" on the ground . \" in reality though , each of these genetic migrations can have included many distinct movements of people across beringia over a great many years - - perhaps centuries or even millennia . and they may have represented many ling - guistic groups . all that is required in order for entire clusters of migrations \" on the ground \" to get read as a single mtdna \" migration \" is a relatively homogeneous gene pool in eastern siberia over the particular time span when the \" genetic mutation \" occurred . the evidence does indeed suggest four genetic migrations , but it really says little or nothing about how many \" real \" migrations there were with - in each of the four clusters , nor does it say anything about linguistic diversity - - much less \" subgroups of amerind . \" we may wish it did , but it does n't . i do note with interest however the rough correlation between the geneticists ' oldest figures and the calculations of nichols ( 1990 in language 66 . 3 ) based on linguistic diversity in the western hemisphere . the more recent sets of mtdna dates fall within the esta - blished archaeological ballpark for clovis believers , although the earliest set certainly does not . one very short contribution of my own here - - mostly my wife 's actually , since she is a molecular geneticist and we talk about these things over breakfast . the yardstick used by mtdna geneticists in these cal - culations may not be appreciably better than that used in glottochrono - logy , i . e . , genetic mutation takes place at a rate which is only rela - tively constant . it can be speeded up by various singular events from cosmic ray bombardment to ingesting certain fungi infecting the grain from your cache pit . biologists try to allow for this sort of thing , but as you can see from the plus / minus dates for each cluster , we are not talking about something as precise as dendrochronology or even radiocarbon dating . the mtdna studies are very interesting but we must bear in mind their limitations and special use of the term \" migration \" . lastly , in an earlier posting andy mentions that i had examined green - berg 's notebooks and determined how he had mislabeled so much of his siouan data in lia . andy 's description of the way the notebooks are laid out is correct , but i have only actually seen xeroxes of the pages of siouan entries , not the notebooks themselves . i might add that the siouan entries in the notebook are hard by the iroquoian , caddoan , yuchi entries demonstrating once again that greenberg had decided on the final classification of these families when he laid out his notebook design and before the vocabularies from the languages were entered . my thanks to john koontz for posting this . sincerely , bob rankin ( university of kansas ) ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . ukans . edu )",

Then I began using the GH1 as directed. \nAfter 8 weeks I took blood tests again. \nMy IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! \nFurthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! \nI definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. \nTo say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1. \nMy \"biological\" age is now that of a 40 year old!\" \n-Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY \"A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood \npressure medication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. \nAfter a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- \nand I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!\" \n-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA \"After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher \nlevel of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision \nwere enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and \nit seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill \nat the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and \na change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, \nI only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra \nkarate workout just to expend all the extra energy!\" \"After 6 months on \nGH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has \nincreased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!\" \n-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA \"As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute \nand a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where \nI could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again \nafter only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!\" \n-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA \"When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print.\" \n-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA \"I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. \nI have been under great stress in my business. \nI believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping \nmy energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst \nof discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. \nColds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. \nMy muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy \nwhen I go out walking.\" \n- Carolyn Munn \"I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that \nI try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed \na doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging \nFormula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. \nThank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!\" \n-Rita Mills McCoy \"I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, \nin my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels \ndropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging \nFormula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal \ncoloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this \nwithout having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking \nfew sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! \n-Alan Ross, 43 years old GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 \navailable on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH.  \n WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)? Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which \nis secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the \nendocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically \nsimilar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few \nhours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones \nsecreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout \nthe body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. \nThe body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously \ndying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original \ncells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to \nstore memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability \nto learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. \nWhen growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the \nall-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance \nwhich is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the \nproper dosage amounts. GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, \nmelatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny \nchemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate \nthe activities of the vital organs. The word \"hormone\" is derived from a Greek word \nmeaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the \neffects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other \nhormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly \nreverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including \nmaking the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also \nhelps restore hair color and hair loss. \n \nTHE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH? Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production \ngradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per \ndecade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, \nits availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians \nhave been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. \nUnfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical \nprofession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been \nthat the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only \neffective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by \nAnti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. \n \nGH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61  \nGrowth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. \nThe amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. \nThis results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age \nof 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, \n200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages \nof 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, \nor Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called \naging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. \nHealing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. \nThose who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include \nan effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.\n After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined \nafter 6 or more months of GH therapy:  _ Improved memory \n_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs \n_ Increased sexual drive and performance \n_ Increased fertility \n_ Enhanced immune system \n_ Quicker wound and fracture healing \n_ New hair growth and color reparation \n_ Sharper vision \n_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance \n_ Increased muscle mass without exercise \n_ Reduction of cellulite and fat \n_ Increased stamina and vitality \n_ Reduction in high blood pressure \n_ Improvement in sleep \n_ Anti-aging \n_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing \n_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol \n_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol \n_ Strengthening of bones \n  IS GH SAFE? \n \nGH has been successfully used in the medical community \nfor over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. \nEdmond Klein, M.D. and L. Cas Terry Ph.D., tested over \n800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that \nGH had substantial benefits and no side effects.\n \n *********************************************************************** \nYou're going to receive Anti-Aging Formula for under $150.00... \nNot even $50.00...

        "content": "special issue machine translation : final call for papers final call for papers the machine translation journal special issue on anaphora resolution in machine translation guest editor : ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) the interpretation of anaphora is crucial for the successful operation of a machine translation system . in particular , it is essential to resolve the anaphoric relation when translating into languages which mark the gender of pronouns . unfortunately , the majority of mt systems developed in the seventies and eighties did not adequately address the problems of identifying the antecedents of anaphors in the source language and producing the anaphoric \" equivalents \" in the target language . as a consequence , only a limited number of mt systems have been successful in translating discourse , rather than isolated sentences . one reason for this situation is that in addition to anaphora resolution being itself a very complicated task , translation adds a further dimension to the problem in that the reference to a discourse entity encoded by a source language anaphor by the speaker ( or writer ) has not only to be identified by the hearer ( translator or translation system ) but also re-encoded in a coreferential expression in a different language . the nineties have seen an intensification of research efforts in anaphora resolution in machine translation . this can be seen in the growing number of related projects which have reported promising new results ( e . g . wada 1990 ; leass & schwall 1991 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1992 ; chen 1992 ; saggion & carvalho 1994 ; preuss et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1995 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1997 ; geldbach 1997 ) . however , we still feel that additional work is needed to highlight and further explore the specifics of the problem in operational mt environments , including fully automatic machine translation and machine - aided translation . we are inviting high-quality , original research papers describing recent advances in anaphora resolution in machine translation . topics to be addressed include ( but are not limited to ) - operational anaphora resolution components in machine translation - resolution of zero pronouns in mt environments - lexical transfer of anaphors across languages - to what extent have the latest trends towards knowledge-poor , corpus - driven and robust approaches in anaphora resolution , been called upon in machine translation ? - what are the most scalable contributory factors / resolution strategies in mt ? - what makes anaphora resolution a more complex task in machine translation ? - multilingual anaphora resolution submission and format articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header \" submission to coat anaphora special issue \" , or in hard-copy to machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 3300 az dordrecht the netherlands or machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 230 accord , ma 02018-023 u . s . a . the submission deadline is 15 may 1998 . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . for more details , please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are also requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk or in hard-copy to ruslan mitkov , school of languages and european studies , university of wolverhampton , stafford st . , wolverhampton wv1 1sb , united kingdom . guest editor : ruslan mitkov school of languages and european studies university of wolverhampton stafford st . wolverhampton wv1 1sb telephone ( 44-1902 ) 322471 fax ( 44-1902 ) 322739 email r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk guest editorial board : breck baldwin ( university of pennsylvania , philadelphia ) david carter ( sri international , cambridge ) guenter goerz ( university of nuernberg / erlangen ) lynette hirschman ( mitre , mclean ) richard kittredge ( university of montreal ) susan luperfoy ( mitre , mclean ) tony mcenery ( lancaster university ) ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) frederique segond ( ranx xerox , grenoble ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) keh - yih su ( national tsing hua university , taiwan ) yorick wilks ( university of sheffield )",

(Yes, i'm ripping, and badly from LOTR) Alright, so NPR's All Things Considered had a wonderful story on the whole Nigerian 419 scams that seem to be running\ninto my inbox constantly (Thanks FoRK!) Turns out, these 419 scams (419 is the statute in Nigeria that this particular form\nof fraud falls under) have actually snared a few people -- NPR reported to the tune of 100 million dollars over a few years, in the US alone.One website listed the 419 scam as being the 'third to fith largest industry in Nigeria' (1), netting billions of dollars\nfrom around the world.   Its large enough to warrant a governmental investigation and a special number to call and report\n(to the secret service, no less) scam abuse. (2)   Folks are apparently being held for ransom if they decide to go\n'check out' the scam.  (3).Listen to the NPR article (4).   What's great about NPR is the commentary at the end. Turns out, this is all unbelievably\ncommon.   The origination, at least to NPR's knowledge, starts with the scam elements being transposed from Nigeria,\nto London, England.   Instead of the bereved widow of a Nigerian national, the originating con was directed to the 'heirs'\nof Sir Frances Drake's estate.   If you were 'chosen' as an heir, you could contribute a portion of your money so that a\nfellow heir (and scam artist) could reclaim the monetary largess in the Court of England, by proving that Elizabeth I had\nnulled Sir Drake's will and taken his fortune as her own.   Oscar\nHartzell, the gent who started this scam, way back in the early 1800s,\nmanaged to gain quite a fortune, all on the backs of idiots.   Sound familiar?A fool and his money, deserve to be parted.

And they found an \nally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale \nfor anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The \nOmagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which \noriginated in the Middle East.\"A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,\" the columnist reports.\"He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.\"It is then explained: \"He had paid \u00c2\u00a3625 to a local sorcerer and \nbelieved that he was invisible.\"In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.\"A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through \nthree walls to steal \u00c2\u00a310,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an \nattack which was well planned and professional,\" the paper reports.\"The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop \nnext door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition \nbetween the back hallway and the front shop.\"Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then \ndrilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the \ncontents.\"The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole \nleft in his store and is quoted as saying: \"On Monday morning when my \nwife was opening, everything looked normal.\"But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the \nshop next door.\"The paper reports that the shop was the target of \"another well \norganised crime\" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.The shop's owner says: \"The closer it gets to Christmas the more \npeople are going to be open to this.\"The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the \nDown Democrat.Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the \nauthorities to \"birch the vandals\" plaguing the local community.He is shocked at reports of the \"wanton destruction by vandals\" and \nissues a call for action.\"The time has come to fight fire with fire,\" he writes, \"before \nunemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start \nusing so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of \nsentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.\"As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, \ncontrolled violence.\"It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the \nbirch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.\"Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly \nliberal who may oppose his plan.\"In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is \nthe order of the day.\"You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures \nbeing introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal \npunishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in \nthe late 1980s.\"However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing \nfaith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before \nit numerically passes Christianity.\"\n-- \nJoe McNally :: Flaneur at Large :: http://www.flaneur.org.uk\n--\n\"I am the centre which exists only because the geometry of the abyss \ndemands it.\" - Fernando Pessoa\n--\nCurrently playing: nothing.To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com Your use of Yahoo!

        "content": "\n[I'm sure somebody will tell me about the original source; it's in a\nnumber of places on the web. -gkm]Forwarded-by: Colin Burgess The Beer Scooter How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night\ndrinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home? As hard as you\ntry, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to\nyour house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer\nScooter.The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased\nto the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched\nout since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and\nhas bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter\nworks in the following fashion:-The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the\n\"slurring gland\" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of\nhis many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a\nwinged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits\nthem in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is\nnot cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket\ncash is taken as payment.This answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend\nso much money?'Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are\nthought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified\nDrinking Injuries).  An undocumented feature of the beer scooter\nis the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of\nTrans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly\nunaccounted for.This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell\nhappened?'With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of\nEmbarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes,\nin descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately\none person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and\nquite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of\ntime. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often\ncause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending\nthe passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences.\nWith recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in\na scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and\npizza crusts.Another question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come\nequipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and\nThump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in\nsuch a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs,\nyou are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity\nsprings ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the\nCTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised\nshins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some\nscooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how\none person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a\nsingle night.PS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably\nget home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a\nT-shirt.\n",

( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry . let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues . as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector . dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , \" dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . \" ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business . the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities . on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio . consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the \" great debate \" among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . \" our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , \" lay said . \" the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . \" moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company \" could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital \" and that enron \" spent too much too soon \" in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter . dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business . it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions . at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous . in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies . _ _ _ _ _ correction statement to 10 / 23 issuealert on european trading : according to a news report from reuters , the u . s . -

code ? or ? pin ? , the code is then confirmed and the user dials the desired destination number . the cards are distributed through various sales channels , and can be purchased at a variety of local merchants , kiosks , etc and are used primarily by tourists , foreign residents , students and immigrants . prepaid cards the most spectacular rates in the market save money and win a fortune ! ! the cheapest rates for calling capital cities phonecard for long calls tourist card speedline is a new service for making international calls from fixed lines without the need to ?

Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.\nBounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency\n  by have some play with time and value\nMost people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's\n  called congnitive dissonance theory\nMost businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale\n  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.\ndecentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround\nfrom technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way\ninconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by \nprotecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. \nThe local information when combined with the technical\ntroubles of providing \"just enough\" forced synchronization\nto remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.\nenforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when\nconcerns are more immedidate.  Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how\npeople cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily\npre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck\nwho thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the\nwhole world would be a little more perfect and everything,\nincluding his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently\nbe in its proper place.Greg\n",

So instead of two couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200 and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.
