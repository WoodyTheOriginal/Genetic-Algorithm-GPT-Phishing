        "content": "Ripped fromhttp://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Linux.Wireless.usage.html\" 11 Access Points, Home Gateways and Ethernet bridging\nMost Access Points act as a MAC level bridge, allowing the Wireless LAN to \nbe a natural extension of a wired network. They are deployed in a cellular \nfashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.\nOn the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to \na WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is \nquite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration.The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't \nwork with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation \nand the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most \noften, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux \nbridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous \nis broken as well). \"[[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge \nour networks? ]]\" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC \nheaders (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the \nright place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on \nhow to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in \nhardware, to force you to buy their Access Points).In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or \nwireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about \nturning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. \"[[ Is this true? ]]\n\" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other \nmethods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... \"\n[[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge. \nBut I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?\nVince. ]]\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\nTo unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@wireless.org.au\nwith \"unsubscribe melbwireless\" in the body of the message\n",

        "content": "project qin wang lloyds tsb pacific limited hong kong branch fax : + 852 - 301 - 66259 thank you for giving me your time . please be patient and read my email to you . i am a staff of lloyds tsb group attached in private banking services . i am contacting you concerning a customer and , an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago , i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication and i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . in 2000 , the subject matter ; ref : bb / tsb / bank / 73 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking services department . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8 . 35 million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case ; i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking services department , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in europe . he directed that i liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in europe . i informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in europe and had the funds available in main land europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm , the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited . he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 20 th june 2002 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit , and i could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate him i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank . four days later , information started to trickle in , that he was apparently dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; he died in testate . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 8 , 370 , 000 . 00 deposited , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm , the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when i sent the funds to the firm , all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process . the finance firm has no single idea of what ' s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal , you share similar details to the late fellow i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with a similar name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you in a few days . i will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer . i will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as accountholder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by i hope you understand because for once i found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny . these chances won ' t pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . let ' s share the blessing . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through this email address ( q _ wang @ o 2 . pl ) i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man ; i happily married with two kids . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting , soon . i await your response . sincerely , qin wang * este mensaje fue enviado desde http : / / www . enterate . com . ar / * conectate gratis a internet desde enterate ! usuario : enterate @ enterate . com . ar clave : enterate desde buenos aires : 4004 - 8007 desde otras ciudades , consulta en :",

        "content": "ecml ' 98 tanlps workshop : first call for paper ecml-98 workshop : first call for papers ecml-98 workshop : towards adaptive nlp - driven systems : linguistic information , learning methods and applications organized by : r . basili , m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata ) , italy since most of the applications , from syntactic to semantic , are lexicon driven , systematic and reliable acquisition on a large scale of linguistic information is the real challenge to natural language processing ( nlp ) . empiricist view on natural language processing and learning has become recently more attractive for a wider research community : computational linguistics , artificial intelligence , psychology then seemed to converge on a specific data-oriented perspective aiming to overcome the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck . it has been often noted that the limited attention paid by the machine learning community to text and speech data seems unjustified . it is thus more and more evident that empirical learning of natural language processing ( nlp ) can alleviate the nlp main problem by means of a variety of methods for the automatic induction of lexical knowledge . lexical knowledge is often hard to compile by hand , and even harder to port and reuse . nlp application systems have still a low impact on real world problems , mainly due to the costs related to reusability and customization of the required lexicons . in particular changes in the domain , causes changes in the lexical information required in the underlying natural language . empirical , symbolic machine learning methods can be perfectly suited for this task like automatic acquisition and adaptation of this klnowledge . rule induction , symbolic approaches to clustering , lazy learning , and inductive logic programming , have been already proposed by a growing community that is entering the challenge for theoretical ( i . e . methodological ) and application purposes a variety of techniques seems to be combined in order to successfully design realistic inductive systems for text processing : the target of this research are methodological and design principles for systems combining linguistic and lexical learning capabilities for large scale language processing tasks . this is what we mean with adaptive nlp - driven systems . within this research enterprise , some issues can favour a sinergistic process between nlp and ml areas : the access to large data sets , that are even increasing over time , due to the telematics facilities available nowaday ; extending the set of typical classes of ml problems to other hard cases ( particularly dense in the nlp processes ) ; adding inductive capabilities to nlp system for tasks related to specific applications ( i . e . information extraction ) . the proposed workshop is thus aiming to stimulate reasearch and discussion on the following aspects : - establishing results and evidencies on the suitability of different ml paradigms on specific levels of representation of lexical knowledge ( morphology , syntax , linguistic inference among others ) - comparison of the quantitative approaches to lexical acquisition with empirical symbolic methods - stimulating discussion on cognitive perspective of some models within a plausible architecture for language processing and learning - establishing results on the applicability of the extracted / induce knowledge within nlp systems , with respect to assessed evaluation criteria , typical of the ml and language engineering ( le ) area - case studies on adaptive nlp systems , i . e . effective nlp systems integrating linguistic inferences with inductive capabilities ( www kb at cmu , ecran ) , - critical review of existing experiences on adaptive nlp systems - establishing guidelines for an evaluation framework of adaptive nlp systems : accuracy of the linguistic process , robustness of the induction process , . . . - promote cooperation among research groups in europe and usa to exchange ideas , data and tools for design and experiment architectures for adaptive nlp systems workshop format : the workshop is expected to cover the whole day . in the first session , a part from an invited talk , we expect to cover methodological issues . papers related to advanced research on suitability of learning paradigms for the different target lexical information will be favoured . prototypical examples in this area are studies on empirical learning of tasks like pos tagging , induction of grammatical information , symbolic learning of word sense disambiguation criteria and lexical semantic information . a panel discussion is expected to close the morning session and focus on principles of suitability for learning paradigms vs . lexical levels . in the second half of the day we expect to stimulate partecipants to cover application areas , like ir and ie , by a couple of invited talks on existing adaptive systems as a basis for presenting novel aspects on integration of nlp capabilities with learning from experience ( examples , errors , performance ) . a set of at least other 3 or 4 papers is expected to concentrate on original research works that we know are currently under development in several reasearch centres in europe ( sheffield university , tilburg , rome tor vergata and torino university ) . a panel discussion on the implication of the adaptive paradigm on existing and potential nlp systems will close the workshop . program committee r . basili ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) m . craven ( carnegie mellon university , usa ) w . daelemans ( university of tilburg , nederlands ) m . t . pazienza ( university of roma , tor vergata , italy ) l . saitta ( university of torino , italy ) c . samuelssonn ( bell labs , at&t , usa ) y . wilks ( university of sheffield , uk ) paper submission : = = = = = = = = = = = = papers should not exceed 3000 words or 6 pages hard copy submission : three copies of the paper should be sent to : roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it electronic submission : electronic submission may be in either self-contained postscript or rtf formats , to basili @ info . utovrm . it for each submission - - whether hard copy or electronic - - a separate plain ascii text email message should be sent to roberto basili , containing the following information : # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if attachments are submitted electronically ) # note : any relevant instructions # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper . . . . . . timetable : workshop announcement and call for papers : 5 january 1998 papers due : 15 february 1998 notification of acceptance : 5 march 1998 final version due : 25 march 1998 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - roberto basili department of computer science , systems and production university of roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . it tel : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7391 fax : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7460 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",

Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. \nRegister for Gnomedex today!   This year's SIC gets the blame for the \nlateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting \nsoftware authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product \ndemonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip \nto an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar \nfaces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged \ne-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information \nexchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and \nsharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, \nis Nick Bradbury's release of \nTopStyle 3.0. \nNick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia \nfamily of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing \nroots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning \nhand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that \npreviously defined  TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is \njust one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of \nthe next two issues.Also in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by \none of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an \nexpert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the \nTraining From the Source \nbook on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for \nColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for \nboth static pages, in the form of \nDreamweaver tips, and tips on dynamic \nsite development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.Jake Ludington\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0GnomeMAIL\nEmail 911\nhttp://www.email911.comE-mail remains the killer app of the Internet, despite all the incredible \nartistic efforts by many Web designers. As we all know, e-mail is also a \nsource of great frustration and misuse - turning otherwise likeable folks \ninto enemies of your inbox defense system. Email 911 aims to educate the \nignorant, while aiding those of us with a reasonable understanding of \neffective e-mail communication in ways to make e-mail even more useful. \nThe newsletters and discussions affiliated with this site should be \nrequired reading for all corporate users, although home users would most \ncertainly benefit as well.

This tool provides a visual representation of all \nconfigurable options available to Apache admins, offering great \nlearning capabilities for newer webmasters, as well as saving time for \nexperienced administrators who tire of scrolling through screen after \nscreen of configurations. A source view makes manual editing of the \nfile easier, by bolding and coloring various configuration directives, \nsimilar to the way HTML editors mark code.

        "content": "URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443841\nDate: Not suppliedBug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It's a pretty basic \nbrowser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified \nbrowsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 \nand his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time \nslightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance \npolicy for regressions.While this \"line in the sand\" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it \nmisses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to \nadd features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see \nfeatures removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, \nrelying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the \nuser interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last \nfeature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size \nrequirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious \nrule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says \"Capacity: 10 \npeople.\" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of \npeople (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the \nsecond floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it \ncontinues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, \nbut there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of \nthem squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla \nsidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes \nhe'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. \nSomeone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way \nto the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He \ndoesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until \neventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that \nnobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the \nfeatures that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in \nMozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want \nsome of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go \ndownload them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat \nwill we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.\n",

        "content": "sex bias and epicenes h . stephen straight is right to mention the importance of the essentially psychological evidence in favor of the idea that epicene he biases perceptions in favor male interpretations . there are considerable number of studies of this effect and a few attempts at interpretation as to how it comes about . essentially , the studies take two tacks . one model involves an interpretation task of some kind in which subjects are induced to provide some form of evidence of male or female interpretation of the referent of some generic epicene . the independent variable was the pronoun coreferent to epicene antecedents in invented sentences presented to subjects . subjects give names to characters , draw pictures , or say directly whether a character is male or female , etc . this type began back in 1970 , with an almost impossible to locate study by kidd . the most famous version was probably martyna 's ( 1978 , 1980 ) work and the latest version i am aware of was an experiment by gastil in 1990 . also , there were experiments by kosrohshahi in 1989 , moulton , robins , & elias in 1978 , and switzer in 1990 . the other type involves production tasks in which subjects selected a coreferential pronoun to complete sentences with antecedents refering generic epicene referents . here the independent variable was the degree of sex-stereotypicality of the generic referent ( e . g . marine vs . teenager vs . nurse ) . this type of study was inaugurated by martyna ( 1978 , 1980 ) . it was also used by gastil . in almost all studies uses of he strongly correlat with male interpretations of the referent . my own naturalistic data shows the same result with referents like ' lumberjack ' and ' particpants in congressional sex scandal ' used more with he than say ' child , ' or ' teacher . ' there are others along both lines , which will be supplied upon request . as for explanations , the most interesting ones for someone ( like me ) who tends to be skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on other aspects of cognition ( please let 's not start that one again ) are by mcconnell - ginet in a number of articles ( e . g . 1988 ) and moulton back in 1977 . moulton eschews notions of markedness and instead compares it to the kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinate category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical . so kleenex are most prototypical paper tissues , sanka is the prototypical decaf coffee ( in the us ) , and so on . note that this involves cognitive interaction with lexical semantics ; there is nothing morphosyntactic going on here . refs : ( i ' ll put full names whenever i remember ; i do n't want to look up all the arts . ) gastil , john ( 1990 ) \" generic pronouns and sexist language sex roles , 23 629-643 kidd , v .

        "content": "**Dublin**: something from the archives. Daev Walsh forwards an article from The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''. This story is also immortalised in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track. Billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely legal, way to make money.BlogEnd: LinkText: Billy in the BowlFrom: daev Subject: The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerA story of my new neighbourhood... The Irish Digest July 1964 The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors. Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes. Many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one who campaigned among the working class. This was \"Billy In The Bowl\"The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels. Seated in this \" bowl \", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs, one in each hand.Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been born without legs. Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an unusually handsome face.This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers-by from their small change.The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would come along.He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his black curly hair, never failed to halt the females. The fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.\"Billy in the Bowl\", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money. The more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening as dusk, was falling. The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on Dublin's North Quays.When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane. As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay concealed. She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.In a few minutes it was all over. The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his \" bowl \", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket. An hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant. And, as \"Billy in the Bowl\" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar.Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or Stoneybatter.On one occasion \" Billy in \"the Bowl \" tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her. The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder and caused a great stir.Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months \"Billy in the Bowl\" was forced to desert his usual haunts. Around this period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.Months passed and \"Billy in the Bowl\" reverted once again to his old pasttime. A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district. But the beggar still rolled along in his \"bowl\" pitied and unsuspected. Then came the night that finished Billy's career of crime.Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help. Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch.Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch. She proved much too strong for him, however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring. Pulling out her large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene. Among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.\"Billy in the Bowl\" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl. The Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night.daev_______________________________ Rev.

Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The\ntag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger\nagainst ragheads, thus:Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has\nadopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political\nopponents.Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I'm\nhurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of\nElizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her\ninstinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly\nmissed.The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and\nself-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset\nabout the death of a complete stranger.Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any\ngovernment ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately\ntransparent:Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling\nhim \"the most honest man it has been my privilege to know\".And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified\nthe controversial . This guarantees any text contained within\nit complete immunity from prosecution:Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted\nperjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling\nand obnoxious behaviour.The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C\nhas, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has\nfurther cautioned that they should never be used together, since the\neffect on the reader could be catastrophic:In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen\nvictim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme,\nStephen Byers noted: \"She was everybody's favourite grandmother who\ntouched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from\nthis tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by\nnext Monday. And you can quote me on that.\"http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

( 2 ) we could have them cancel their old options and purchase on the open market some options with longer terms . the lowest strike price available for january 04 leaps is $ 30 and the term still isn ' t quite long enough - most affected options have a strike price between $ 15 and $ 20 . this alternative would need tax , accounting , and sec research and would cost about $ 4 mm in total .

        "content": "re : 5 . 1404 comparative method in linguistics karl teeter is mistaken , i think , when he says that you cannot classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences in the lexical items , when he says that you would treat english and french as related ( via the norman borrowings ) if you did this , when he says that the idea of using this method is \" novel \" , when he says that you can only classify lamnguages as related if you have written a comparative grammar , etc . ( a ) for many language families , there is no other basis for classification available , because they lack the kind of morphological complexity so beloved of indo - europeanists , algonkianists , and those other - ists who happen to enjoy its blessings in \" their \" languages , ( b ) the danger of confusing borrowings for cognates is always real , but it is easy to see that the lexical connaections of english with french are more transparent phonologically and less central semantically than those with dutch , hence more recent , hence borrowings . ( c ) there is nothing novel in what i am saying , since it is the method which , for example , edward sapir used to establish that the uto - aztecan languages are really a family ( rather than three families ) . ( d ) you cannot possibly realistically expect normal people to spend time writing comparative grammars of languages which have not previously been shown to be related . so classification must come first ! on the other hand , it is perfectly easy to write a \" crazy \" comparative grammar for any random group of languages , e . g . , french and english . the last is perhaps the most important point : reconstruction of morphological systems can be done well or badly , so can comparison of lexical items . both can yield correct results ; both can also produce garbage . p . s . i say ' lexical items ' deliberately , because there seem to be language families where there is no morphology at all to compare . in most cases , howveer , there are some bound morphemes , and one compares those as well ( as did sapir in the case of uto - aztecan ) . but this is a far cry from reconstructing the kind of intricate morphological patterns found in the older indo - european languages , for example , but absent from many other language families .",

' , which is apparently what chadwick is envisioning . ) ) now , i daresay there may be individual linguists who do react this way , ) just as in previous eras there were scientists who would from time to ) time redefine the standards of what constituted full humanity . or civi - ) lization , or what have you , to maintain the claim that whatever it was , ) the native peoples of africa and the western hemisphere did n't have it . ) but i certainly do n't , and i ' m not aware of any of my colleagues that ) do insist , as the sectional headline in the nyt book review has it , ' on ) keeping language and reason for humans alone ' ( i ' m also a little be - ) mused at this conflation of language and reason ; language has never ) struck me as an entirely ' rational ' process ) , much less that , as chadwick ) and , by derivation , said headline imply , that as a professional class we ) are unanimous in doing so . ) ) i ' m considering writing a letter to the editor to complain about this ; if ) anybody else has already done so , please let me know . but what i really ) want to know is , what is the current general consensus ( if there is one ) of ) the field on this subject ? are the claims in the savage - rumbaugh & lewin ) book anent kanzi 's linguistic ability valid ? or is some further clari - ) fication in order ? is it just that some researchers in this area have ) a ( perhaps understandable ) chip on their shoulder ? or is there a real ) conflict between theoretical linguists on the one hand and physical an - ) thropologists and primatologists on the other on this subject ? first of all , david pesetsky did write a letter to the new york times , which was published in the dec . 25 issue of the times book review , and i refer all interested parties to it ( for some reason , i can't find my copy at the moment ) . secondly , i 'd like to thank the following scholars who got in touch with me over the holidays to discuss this issue , discussion to be summarized below : john h . chalmers ( non12 @ cyber . net ) dick hudson ( uclrah @ ucl . ac . uk ) massimo piattelli - palmarini ( piattem @ dipsco . hsr . it ) tom j . pulju ( pulju @ ricevm1 . rice . edu ) harold schiffman ( haroldfs @ u . washington . edu ) discussion proceeded along two logically distinct questions : ( 1 ) what is currently the most accurate assessment of the ' linguistic performance ' , ( and , by inference , linguistic ability ) of the anthropoids ? ( 2 ) why are such people as the gardners , savage - rumbaugh , chadwick , etc . so irritated at us ? on the first question , all of my respondents , as well as david pesetsky , seem to be agreed that the most impressive ' linguistic ' performance of chimps and gorillas reported in the literature is at a level roughly equi - valent to that of a human child of approximately two years of age , but that the anthropoids seem to be unable to develop beyond that stage . in particular , they show no evidence for syntactic structure , nor for any ability to distance themselves temporally or spatially from the referents of their statements . i received statements such as the following : ' the most successful of the apes have managed to reach more or less the level of children in the two-word utterance stage . the size of the lexi - con is about the same , as is the combinatory ability . ' ' the apes master a refined system of communication , and are capable of some abstract thinking , but lack the very fundamentals of human language ( recursiveness , structure-dependency , parsing into constituents , etc . ) . ' ' the chimps mostly have a lexicon , and a rudimentary syntax that lets them distinguish between actor and patient , but that 's about all . . . . the chimps ( a ) have no morphology to speak of ( b ) can't use displacement of the message ( i . e . , can't talk about the past or future , or something that happens / ed in another location ) ' [ at a venture , i would guess that they can't handle contrafactuals either . ] ' it is claimed that the ape \" utterances \" lack grammaticality or syntax . the apes can make the correct symbolic associations , but have no sense of grammatical patterning . in two and three \" word \" sentences , the order of the elements is variable and each element maybe repeated any number of times in any order and independently of the rest ( sequences like give banana give kanzi kanzi banana kanzi give , etc . ) ' one of my respondents , partly on the basis of hanns own occasionally frus - trating experiences resulting from the geographical proximity of an insti - tution presumably devoted to the 's tudy ' of anthropoid language , made some critical statements about the scientific methodology of some of this research . in particular , after referring to hockett 's 16 'd esign fea - tures ' of language , hann remarks : ' the proponents ' claim that [ chimps ] do have cultural transmission , because washo taught her son , does n't bear up under much scrutiny ; washo had to be rewarded to learn every sign and her son has not learned as many , nor passed them on to any other chimp . i see what the chimps learned as the equivalent of a pidgin ; but creoliza - tion never took place . ' which implies ( 1 ) that anthropoid ' language ' ac - tually corresponds to the skinnerian model refuted by chomsky in his fa - mous review as regards human language and ( 2 ) that it is not sufficiently ' natural ' to the anthropoids for them to feel motivated to transmit it successfully . some of my respondents addressed some of the wider theoretical and metho - dological issues relevant to linguistics implicit in this discussion . one opined ' that some dismissal of ape language research is partly , and unconsciously , motivated by a turf-protection instinct . we ' re all alrea - dy uneasy about the fact that there are certain subfields of linguistics whose importance we acknowledge but which we ' re not personally terribly well-versed in . . . . i think many theoretical linguists breathed a sigh of relief when terrace announced that [ the chimp ] nim had n't really learned human language at all . it meant that they did n't have to worry about mo - difying their theories to fit ape language data . ' another said , ' most linguists do n't really care ( at least not consciously ) about whether apes can learn language as such , but they do care deeply about whether lan - guage is \" sui generis \" and innate or not . . . . as far as linguists are concerned , we ' re divided over chomsky 's claim that language is a geneti - cally-programmed module , rather than an area of knowledge which is han - dled by general cognition . if apes can't learn language at all , that supports the chomskyan view ( which presumably involves some cataclysmic mutation say 100 , 000 years ago , or at least since we split off from the other primates ) . if they can learn some of it , we have evidence for ge - neral cognition ( where apes are presumably less well endowed than us , so you 'd expect partial success ) . ' in further discussion we agreed that this argument only held if we accept a 's trong ' version of the relevant dichotomy implicit in the innateness hypothesis , according to which human linguistic ability is overwhelmingly if not completely independent of general human cognition . i pointed out that even if chimps are demonstrably distinct from us on a genetic level they still share over 98 % of our dna . so even if they share some of our linguistic ability it might mean that they also share some of the distinc - tive genetic endowment that provides it . a more effective test would be on cetaceans or pachyderms , which are nowhere as nearly related to us as chimps are but which appear to have roughly comparable cognitive levels . if they also share a certain amount of our linguistic ability , that would indicate that at least that amount is probably dependent more on general cognitive ability than on any specific genetic endowment . if chimps , dolphins , elephants , whatever , can't master human language but have other modes of communication * not isomorphic * with ours but of * comparable com - plexity and flexibility * , then this would give us the opportunity to stu - dy how much of human language is necessary to the general phenomenon of language and how much is incidental and of relevance only to our species ; it might also enable us to talk about the ' innateness ' of human linguistic ability in terms that would not be offputting to geneticists . on the second question , the basis for the irritation towards academic lin - guists on the part of the proponents of anthropoid language , there was some consensus that they were working with an overly simplistic concep - tion of what constitutes language , and were offended that we refused to share it . typical were the following remarks : ' all the [ proponents ] of animal language , and of its continuity with hu - man language , assume that human natural languages simply * are * the result of communication and use . . . . the basic design of human languages is * not * dictated by use , and we can easily conceive of species that would possess a * radically * different design for language and would communicate just as well , if not better . ' ' the gardners et al . have an extremely elementary grasp of what is real language . they think that if they have a lexicon and bare syntax , that 's all there is . their other argument , that the apes have \" real \" sign lan - guage , is also pitiful . . . . the approach trivializes both oral languages and sign languages . ' there was , however , some acknowledgment that some of the ' blame ' for this state of affairs belongs on our doorstep . the ' trivialization ' just men - tioned was claimed to be due at least in part to inadequacies in state - ments by linguists in the 50 's and 60 's . one respondent in particular pointed to an inveterate tendency to try to identify a single , defining , characteristic as the sine qua non of human linguistic ability , rather than accepting the fact that such important distinctions are often proper - ly made on the basis of mosaics of characteristics . in particular , much research in anthropoid ' language ' has apparently focussed on the ability of chimps and gorillas to coin novel expressions , unanticipated by their human teachers / handlers , on the basis of a finite number of memorized ' lexemes ' and some basic combinatorial principles . this effort has suppo - sedly been motivated by early assertions by academic linguists that what distinguishes human language from all other forms of animal communication is its creative ability . when the gardners , etc . , demonstrate that their apes are capable of similar creativity and we then say , ' very nice but that 's not language ' , they are understandably miffed . in response to this , i think what is necessary is greater tact , humility , and honesty on all our parts . we need to admit up front that we ( or our predecessors ) have oversimplified in the past , and give credit to the ape researchers for helping to elucidate the issues . and we need to make it clear that what chimps , gorillas , and two-year - old humans share is in some sense a * rudimentary * linguistic ability , but not equivalent to what adult humans do . in short , we need to increase everybody 's awareness of the inherent rich - ness and complexity of human linguistic behaviour , which to my mind means we need to devote more time and energy to introductory courses in general linguistics ! harold schiffman reports some encouraging success in this direction with a course on linguistic anthropology at the university of washington . further discussion on the issues raised here is welcome , either in perso - nal communication with me or in general discussion on the list . i hope in the not too distant to be able to post a short list of references to published literature on this subject . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *",
