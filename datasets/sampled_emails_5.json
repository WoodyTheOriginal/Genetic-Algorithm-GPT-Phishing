how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? this workshop is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts will consider these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on acl workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational inguistics community as a whole . the workshop will include ample time for discussion . a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the acl workshop . topics - - - - - the workshop will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics - based ) of pre-parsing , parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . we invite submissions which report on work in these areas . all papers should clearly identify how the work addresses the issues and questions outlined above . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only hard-copy submissions will be accepted . authors should submit six ( 6 ) copies of the full-length paper ( 3500-5000 words ) . submissions should be sent to : nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa style files and templates for preparing submissions can be found at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : march 23 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 scientific committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - charles fillmore university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid ( tentative ) university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy information sciences institute , usa nancy ide vassar college , usa lauri karttunen ( tentative ) rank xerox research , france kimmo koskenniemi ( tentative ) university of helsinki , finland mun kew leong national university of singapore joseph mariani limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg ( tentative ) new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura ( tentative ) nec , japan martha palmer university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky brandeis university , usa peter schaueble eth , switzerland oliviero stock irst , italy felisa verdejo uned , spain piek vossen university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster dfki , germany organizers - - - - - - - - - robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa eduard hovy , isi , university of southern california , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa information - - - - - - - - - - information on the workshop can be found at http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / translingual . html inquiries may be addressed to the organizers : robert frederking < ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu > eduard hovy < hovy @ isi . edu > nancy ide < ide @ cs . vassar . edu >",

        "content": "the evaluation of parsing systems - workshop call for papers the evaluation of parsing systems a workshop jointly organised by the cec language engineering 1 projects sparkle and ecran to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 this workshop will provide a forum for researchers interested in the development and evaluation of natural language grammars and parsing systems , and in the creation of syntactically annotated reference corpora . organisers : john carroll , roberto basili , nicoletta calzolari , robert gaizauskas , gregory grefenstette workshop scope and aims the aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussion of evaluation methods for parsing systems , and proposals for the development of syntactically annotated language resources . with increased attention to evaluation of component technology in language engineering , evaluation of parsing systems is rapidly becoming a key issue . numerous methods have been proposed and while one , the parseval / penn treebank scheme , has gained wide usage , this has to some extent been due to the absence of workable alternatives rather than to whole-hearted support . parseval / ptb evaluation has several limitations and drawbacks , including a commitment to a particular style of grammatical analysis , and oversensitivity to certain innocuous types of misanalysis while failing to penalise other common types of more serious mistake . also , the original published description of the scheme - - and the evaluation software widely distributed as a follow-up to it - - is specific to the english language . it may be that there are currently no alternative more workable schemes or proposals , but this needs to be more fully discussed : this workshop will provide an opportunity for such a debate . this workshop is particularly timely given the large number of cec language engineering projects that involve parsing in one form or another and which need to evaluate and share the results of their efforts . parsing is an essential part of many larger applications , such as information extraction , which have gained in importance over the last few years . often in such systems , the strength of the parser and grammar has a direct effect on the desired results , and thus achieving good results rests on being able to determine and improve weaknesses in the parser / grammar . without a reliable parser evaluation method this cannot be done effectively . a parsing evaluation workshop is also appropriate at this time given the imminent creation of large-scale syntactically annotated resources for european languages . contributions from those involved in such activities are welcomed , so as to improve communication between the resource construction and the resource utilisation communities . this should ensure that the resources constructed are maximally useful to the general language engineering community . the organisation of this workshop brings together two european language engineering projects which are closely related and whose partners share similar research interests : sparkle and ecran . the organisers solicit contributions from the general community on the following topics : - descriptions of generic syntactic annotation schemes - methodologies and metrics for parsing system evaluation - reports and analyses of the results of utilising particular parser evaluation schemes -

        "content": "puc press release announcing deal with edison puc and edison settle federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates the california public utilities commission ( puc ) and southern california edison ( edison ) today reached a settlement in the filed rate doctrine lawsuit edison filed in federal court against the puc . the settlement is intended to restore edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers ; limit ratepayers ' costs of paying off the debt ; and maintain the state ' s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable , certain period of time . the terms of the settlement agreement include : ? edison will apply cash on hand , plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs , to paying off its back debt . the puc and edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt edison had at august 31 , 2001 , less the cash on hand on that date , less an additional $ 300 million adjustment . the amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $ 3 billion as of the end of this month . the parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap . ? edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003 , or on the full payment of its debt , if sooner . if edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003 , the commission retains the discretion to determine whether edison will pay a dividend in 2004 . edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005 . since edison ' s annual dividend has typically been about $ 400 million , edison ' s shareholders will have forgone at least $ 1 . 2 billion in dividends and possibly more , in addition to the $ 300 million adjustment . ? edison will apply 100 % of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt . edison commits through court order to work with the puc and the attorney general in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers . ? the puc can direct edison to use $ 150 million each year for other utility purposes , including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies , which would otherwise be used to pay down the edison debt . ? the puc agrees not to lower edison ' s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered . however , rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced dwr revenue needs . ? the puc agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate , to enable edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if edison ' s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003 . ? there are no concessions of puc or state regulations or regulatory authority over edison , nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities . ? edison may make up to $ 900 million in capital expenditures annually . \" this settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power , while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of california , \" said loretta lynch , president of the puc . \" the settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers . \" this agreement settles a november 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by edison against the puc , in which edison claimed that the commission ' s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates , violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property . under this agreement , edison will release the puc from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the commission ' s decisions implementing ab lx , ab 6 x , and the turn accounting proposal . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : dasovich , jeff sent : tuesday , october 02 , 2001 4 : 42 pm to : dasovich , jeff ; kean , steven j . ; belden , tim ; sharp , vicki ; blachman , jeremy ; comnes , alan ; tribolet , michael ; walsh , kristin ; delainey , david ; leff , dan ; frazier , lamar ; keeney , kevin ; gahn , scott ; swain , steve ; lavorato , john ; kaufman , paul ; steffes , james d . ; calger , christopher f . ; mara , susan ; black , don ; richter , jeff ; kitchen , louise ; dietrich , janet ; mara , susan ; robertson , linda ; kingerski , harry ; denne , karen ; palmer , mark a .

        "content": "The Times August 28, 2002\n \n It's August, and big cats are on the prowl\n By Alan Hamilton\n \n \n \n ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British\n countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,\n vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,\n including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair\n samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its\n undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. \n \n Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,\n founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has\n received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. \n \n \u00c2\u201cDuring the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat\n activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from\n the public has been fantastic,\u00c2\u201d Mr Bamping said. \u00c2\u201cBig cats in Britain are\n real. They are out there, they are breeding; there\u00c2\u2019s more of them.\u00c2\u201d \n \n Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark\n Fraser, who heads the society\u00c2\u2019s Scottish arm, said: \u00c2\u201cLynx are now present in\n the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I don\u00c2\u2019t\n want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several\n hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.\u00c2\u201d \n \n Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which\n includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as\n well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in\n Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand\n was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black\n hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. \n \n The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of\n trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the\n beasts, which it will then present to the Government. \n \n It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.\n Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. \n \n Next in August: record abductions by aliens.\n \n \n------------------------ Yahoo!

        "content": "> Interesting. I've always wondered about things 'considered' to be bad. \n> Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?Oh goodie. My final year project rears its head :-)> Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto \n> or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of \n> programming syntaxMuch as I would like to answer an unqualified \"yes\", I must admit: if \nyou already code in a style that makes heavy use of GOTOs, coding in the \nsame style with GOSUBs or function calls does not improve code. Much the \nsame as when the manuals on \"modular coding\" said to write modules that \nwould fit on a single sheet of computer paper, lots of coders proceeded \nto split their code into arbitrary 60-line chunks. :)However, \"Go-to considered harmful\" points out that to analyse (==debug) \ncode, you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is, and \nwhat the values of the variables are at that point. This is an easy(tm) \njob if the code uses assignment, if(), for() and functions, but not if \nit uses GOTO. (See http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF \nfor the full letter).Despite being one of Dijkstra's brain-damaged children who learned BASIC \nat an early age :) I never use GOTO anymore (or any of its bastard \noffspring like break, continue, fudged function calls with sleight of \nhand in the variables). My code is longer than it might be if I had used \nGOTO at a critical, handy point. However, code is a bit like networks - \nyou always end up adding bits on where you didn't expect to - and the \nbenefit is felt when another person (like myself but in three months \ntime) is modifying or debugging it and doesn't have to go through the \nhassle of dealing with the impact of the GOTO.Dave\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n",

That's my understanding of how it works anyway. > > John > > Subject: Re: [ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux:Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2 (gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.Therefore: export CFLAGS=\"-O3 -march=\" && CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGSThis is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this binary to a lower class CPU and execute it.So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.I'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try using icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not prepared to go to this length.For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it and see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been several days before I'm ready to build X anyway.Cheers, John Gay-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

If you want to stop the bootleggers do not\nrelease the data to the public.I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking\nthe key gives away it's secret.the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP\nfor example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the\nnightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we\nneeded to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the\nXP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my\ncomputer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me\nreturn them and get my money back.the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.jef",

        "content": "bilingualism i ' m not sure why , but i was reluctant to post on the issue of us bilingualism . in any case , i feel obliged to say this as an educational linguist who has worked in esl and tangentially in bilingual ed teacher education . first of all , the entire notion that bilingual ed was , is , or could be ( designed as ) a method for introducing national plurilingualism is a nonstarter . therefore any debates about it using plurilingualism as argument get nowhere . in fact , with out a wish to flame anyone ( because i do n't think it was intentional ) the entire argument that we should stop bilingual ed because of its anti - english or anti-standard english agenda is of a kind very familiar to us in educational circles . it 's little different than what we hear from those who argue that proponents of progressive educational idea x ( e . g . whole langauge reading instruction , process writing , outcomes-based ed . ) are trying to bring down standards , undermine society , do something unamerican , and so on . it is essentially a rhetorical manipulation of the worst kind , based on false suppositions , and intended to push hot buttons . by saying this i am not defending bilingual ed or any other movement . however , i think these need to be debated on their educational merits . why is the argument a nonstarter ? admittedly , there are those in education who propose that students have the right to their own dialect language or what-have - you , and that they should n't have to learn standard english in school . however , they are largely involved in an academic exercise that takes place in the pages of journals of various sorts . they do not shape policy . the avowed purpose of the vast majority of bilingual ed programs is usually to ease a limited english proficient child into the mainstream . the idea is that if they take content area courses in their first language they will not fall behind while learning english . the programs contain esl components that supposedly will allow the kids to mainstream later . some programs do encourage native language literacy and continue classes native language classes throughout a child 's school career . some take very young english speaking kids and put them into these classes on an immersion basis . since usually older english speaking kids in other schools are trying , in theory , to learn the same language the immigrant kids are already fluent in , i fail to see what is controversial about that . it seems to be designed , in theory again , to encourage personal , not societal , bilingualism . the failings of bilingual ed , in places where it has failed , have more to do with poor educational practice than with policy . if kids are arriving at college after say five years in bilingual ed , and are entering esl programs , something did n't work right . to anyone remotely familiar with urban schools , that should hardly be a surprise . now , on a national level i think we should look at us bilingualism and forget about catalonia or the basque country for a moment . bilingualism in the us has endured over many generations in several situations : ( i ) tight - knit religious communities : hasidic jews who speak yiddish , old order amish , brethren , and mennonites , who speak their german dialects . ( ii ) groups who were overtaken , to put it nicely , by english speakers : the navajo and other indigenious peoples ; french creole speakers in louisiana , spanish in the southwest . ( iii ) isolated communities : gullah in south carolina and georgia . immigrants , it would seem , tend to assimilate linguistically over a few , typically very few generations . in spite of the myth that spanish - speakers are somehow different on this score , i think , it would be instructive to look at the case of new york , which is full of people young hispanics who cannot speak more than a few words of spanish - this in spite of continuing immigration from spanish - speaking countries . as a non - yiddish or hebrew speaking ashkanazi jew , i entirely understand this phenomenon although as a learner of spanish as a foreign language , i lament the lost opportunity . finally , i think it would be more instructive to look at which americans feel threatened by the non-existent threat of the demise of something that has never existed ( the us as a monolingual nation ) and try to figure out why people feel that way . why , for example , is it an issue in the west and not in new york ? why is it associated with right and not the left ? why has it come up now again ? is it it really just good old american nativism , ' 90s style , or is there something different going on ? also , why have n't we in linguistics and education done more to communicate with mainstream americans that the whole thing is a lot of nonsense ? michael newman dept . of educational theory & practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu",

        "content": "Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with \nno reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to \nbe that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la \nWilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, \nev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more \npartners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether \nthe fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely \npromiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get \neven more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other \nmen. \nhttp://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html<>\nAs for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme \npromiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the \nBand Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses \nhow, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you \nmight call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having \nmany partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an \nexplicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.\n    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of \nSchiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played \nin spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many \nothers. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that \nthere was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.Tom\n",

bc hydro ' s rate freeze lingers ? bpa rates expected to rise , california refunds doubtful aluminum smelters ( dsi ' s ) on 1 october 2001 the long - term relationship between dsi ' s and bpa for preferred rates will end as bonneville power administration ' s new rate case takes effect . after 2001 , dsi ' s become discretionary customers of bonneville power administration . dsi ' s have been playing the game of slowly ' migrating ' their load to local utilities in 9 . 9 mw annual increments to avoid being subject to bonneville ' s new large single load ( nlsl ) designation and losing their preferred rate status . now they are beginning to slip quietly back onto bpa ' s federal system , and officials at bonneville have been willing partners in attempting to circumvent their own nlsl regulations , which were established in 1980 . in an effort to secure existing dsi relationships , bpa is now undertaking a review of its nlsl regulation to provide an exemption for these companies . bpa is opposed by the public power council , the representative of the public utilities in the pacific northwest that focuses bpa rate - making , which has sent a letter to the assistant secretary of energy to express its objections to bpa ' s proposed actions . the ppc was instrumental in raising public awareness earlier this year about the favored status of the dsi ' s as large industrial customers - they are moving aggressively to block bpa from giving the aluminum smelters any additional favored treatment . the ability of bpa to exempt dsi ' s from its nlsl regulation will shape the direction of negotiations between aluminum smelters and other power producers in the region . it remains to be seen whether or not the public power council will initiate a legal battle to stop the dsi ' s from obtaining this special treatment . while moving to maintain positive relationships with the dsi ' s , bpa is not enthusiastic about giving power back to the smelters because they think they will need all the water they can spare for the fish . bpa has concerns that supplies will be tight again in the fall and early winter - they won ' t really benefit much , even from normal or better precipitation , until the melt starts next april . bpa wants to buy back power from the smelters for at least a year and probably would not entertain any overtures from smelters until then . about the only possibility for smelters to go back on line would be for them to use the money they ' re getting from bpa to subsidize power purchases on the spot market . however , there would be a lot of risk in that , and bpa people don ' t think market prices would enable them to be very profitable , even with the bpa money helping . as of april 1 , three smelters should come back on line ; nw aluminum , goldendale aluminum , longville aluminum ? alcoa aluminum there is not much news happening on the negotiating end between alcoa and bc hydro right now . information is still fairly tight - lipped , however , employees of alcoa ' s idled intalco smelter have been shifted to other capital projects in the facility to prepare the plant for an eventual restart . this may indicate the direction of negotiations . ? kaiser aluminum as odd man out , kaiser has little to say in northwestern energy developments . the company will obviously benefit if bonneville is able to fight off the public utilities , but they are in such a weak bargaining position right now that they might have to restart operations just to get revenues moving again , though there is no direct evidence to support this view at this time . british columbia politics ? bc government the latest news from british columbia is that the bc liberal government is doing quite nicely in implementing its conservative strategy . public opinion remains quite high , and they have virtually completed all of their campaign promises for the first 90 - day period . even former ndp legislators are surprised at the efficiency with which the government is proceeding . political strategists are watching the anwr vote in the us very carefully , not only because it will have a major impact on the natural gas and oil pipeline going through northern bc , but also because it is illustrating the environment vs . labor fallout . in the recent election , the green party of british columbia performed surprisingly well , garnering around 12 % of the vote in any typical race , contributing directly to the downfall of the ndp . premier gordon campbell ' s core review of bc government is due by october , and it appears that the process will be primarily a cost - cutting measure . they are moving to reduce expenditures , which for bc hydro ' s sake , will include community outreach , student scholarship and any other ' feel good ' programs currently being undertaken by hydro . the real long - term policy planning , however , is expected to take place in january when campbell ' s team ( brenda eaton , the deputy premiere ; doug allen , the premiere ' s consultant ; and jack ebbels , deputy energy minister ) works in conjunction with neufeld to construct bc ' s long - term energy plan . bc hydro bc hydro has formally signed on as a participant in the rto west regional transmission organization as a filing utility . rto west is currently being overseen by the western governor ' s association and developed as allowed by ferc . rto west will be the oversight entity in the western states and canada that will manage electricity transmission issues . we are also expecting alberta to come on board rto west shortly . with regard to a potential rate hearing , bc hydro has recently put a freeze on rates in the province that will last until 2003 . the word on this move is that it will allow chairman bell to generate some political cover as he begins to shave off parts of the business , such as transmission and information technology - focusing bc hydro ' s core operations on additional generation , exports / trading , and delivery . the public concern over privatization is that it will cause rates to skyrocket , similar to what happened in california - but bell has moved to head off these concerns with the rate freeze . as a function of increasing bc hydro ' s generation capacity , they are looking very carefully at building on two sites : site c ( hydroelectric dam ) and burrard thermal . bpa ? financial status in what was expected to be a quiet period in rates matters , bpa dropped a bombshell by announcing it was considering triggering the fb crac on 1 october . this would increase rates over the 46 % lb crac rate increase announced earlier - - despite forecasts that such an increase would be unnecessary . what this essentially does is allow bpa to bypass its initial rate case increase of 46 % , utilizing a stop - gap measure under federal regulations . bpa cited a number of reasons why it was considering imposing an fb crac , including losses trading power this summer , changes in the accounting treatment of some dsi buyouts , and uncertainty whether the california iso and px can pay monies owed bpa . bpa did note , however , that it also had more than one hundred million additional dollars in bond refinancing money not accounted in the fb crac calculation . if the fb crac triggers by any amount , bpa would have the option of \" truing up \" its calculation of the fb crac in march and could change the rates again if bpa ' s actual financial condition on 30 september differs from what is estimated now , or if bpa changes its accounting assumptions further . bpa representatives suggest strongly that there is a good chance that a rate increase would be announced early and also indicated that the specific number would be much less than the earlier load - based crac increase ( of about 46 % ) - - \" much less than 20 % , and probably much , much less than 20 % . \" the public power council staff has written to and met with steve wright , bpa acting administrator , in an effort to convince bpa that a fc crac is unnecessary . we should know bpa ' s decision by 31 august . ? ferc refunds at this time , bpa will not seek refunds in the ongoing ferc proceedings - or submit to the process for purposes of others seeking refunds against bpa - for the following reasons : 1 ) bpa believes ferc lacks jurisdiction over bpa . 2 ) the proceedings are so convoluted ( and the transactions so complicated ) that bpa asserts that there is no realistic hope of unwinding all of the transactions necessary to equitably order refunds . insofar as other parties collecting against bpa , in some cases bpa was only the remarketing agent acting at the behest of , for example , aluminum smelters . ferc would have to proceed against these third parties , and often that money has already been spent . 3 ) with respect to claims by the calif . dwr ( $ 71 million ) , a similar claim in the separate california ferc proceeding was disallowed on 14 june . it would be incongruous to allow the claim here . in this claim , ferc denied dwr access to refunds in situations where there was a willing buyer and willing seller . 4 ) then there are the assorted politics involved . first , bpa believes that the political costs of pursuing refunds outweigh any eventual benefit that might be received . bpa calculates its potential exposure in these refund proceedings at circa $ 400 million , while it believes its own potential claims could amount to $ 500 million - thus a potential $ 100 million net gain . for reasons cited , however , we believe it highly unlikely they will seek refunds . second , with respect to others seeking refunds against bpa , five nw senators who sit on the senate energy committee would be very upset if ferc allowed california parties to collect against bpa ; and ferc to some extent is likely to be responsive to this sentiment . bpa is confident of its legal position in this matter estimating less than a 10 % chance of their being forced to submit to ferc in this matter . of course , if they were forced to submit to ferc jurisdiction , they would cross claim against other parties and seek refunds . even if bpa received refunds , we do not believe that it would affect the ability of aluminum smelters to come back on - line . we anticipate that on 1 april 2002 , three smelters ( amounting to between 300 - 500 mw ) will come back on line : northwest aluminum & goldendale aluminum ( 230 mw ) , and longville aluminum ( 100 mw ) . ? spill - related issues fish returns for this year have been especially high . if the ocean stays productive for the next few years , as some think it might , the region could have an enormous opportunity to rebuild the salmon and steelhead runs and make huge strides towards success in this area . behind - the - scenes work continues on the implementation plan ( on the biological opinion on the hydro system ) , with the region ' s states and tribes trying to play a stronger role in designing the columbia river strategy . ppc and northwest irrigation utilities were admitted to the national wildlife federation et al v . nmfs lawsuit as defendant interveners , and the court is now making plans to try mediation between the parties .",

Filmmakers \n    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest \n    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming \n    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce \n    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics \n    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances \n    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the \n    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of \n    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James \n    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary \n    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry \n    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish \n    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, \n    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously \n    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, \n    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to \n    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no \n    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to \n    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

Perhaps we look at the sequences file\nmore than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can\nstick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.\nWe could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -\nTcl has had \"clock seconds\" (like gettimeofday) and \"clock clicks\"\n(high resolution timer) for some time.

Of course, we are measuring all\nthe overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.>>>Chris Garrigues said:\n > > From:  Brent Welch \n > > Date:  Wed, 28 Aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700\n > >\n > > \n > > >>>Robert Elz said:\n > >  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the\n > >  > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.\n > > \n > > In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify\n > time,\n > > but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to\n > > check their date stamp, you could just read them again.\n > \n > Do you really think this is true?

Set in the old west.A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly \nsurrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians \ntake the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the \ntribe deals with their victims:\nEach day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to \ngrant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible \nslow death. Time for your first wish.The cowboy thinks a bit, and says \"I want to talk to my horse.\" So the \nindians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the \nhorse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a \nbeautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, \nappropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at \nyesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says \"I want to \ntalk to my horse\". So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in \nits ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes \nback, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy \nand the women go in the tent, ..., etc.On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are \neager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, \nand the cowboy again says \"I want to talk to my horse.\" The horse is \nbrought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, \nstares right at him, and says -- \"Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!\"\nOwen\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n",

        "content": "book review gopnik , alison and andrew n . meltzoff ( 1997 ) words , thoughts and theories . cambridge : mit press . 268 pages . $ 14 ( paperback ) reviewd by laura wagner , university of massachusetts . gopnik and meltzoff ( g&m ) have written a book that is full of ideas and information . they are interested in what our representations of the world look like and they are pushing the view they call the theory theory : that our representations are organized around theories . more than that , they argue that children 's representations of the world are also organized around theories and that developmental changes children undergo are in fact changes in their theories . even more than that , they argue that the theory revisions that children make are of precisely the same type as scientific theory revisions . that is , the difference between a 9 month old and an 18 month old is essentially the same as that between a newtonian physicist and an einsteinian physicist : they possess qualitatively different theories of how the world works . the use of \" words \" in the title refers to two claims that g&m make : one , that children 's early vocabulary reflects technical notions in their theory du jour and two , that linguistic elements can act as part of the evidence children use in theory building . the book is divided into three sections , in addition to the introduction and conclusion . the first section addresses the theoretical commitments of the theory theory and relates it other theories of cognitive organization and development . the second section examines three domains of knowledge for evidence of children 's changing theories . the third section has a neo - whorfian flavor and addresses the question of how different languages could effect children 's theory-building . part 1 : the theory theory in this section , g&m face head on what is certainly the most difficult of their claims to swallow , namely that children 's early theories about the world are qualitatively the same as scientific theories and subject to revision in the same ways . while acknowledging that there are many differences between the ways scientists and infants operate , they nevertheless maintain that they both construct the same sorts of theories in the same ways . the theories of both are abstract and general , and therefore provide a means for making predictions in a variety of domains . both groups are concerned with the match of the theory to the world and will maintain a theory only as long as the evidence supports it . when evidence mounts against a theory , the theory holder goes into a transitional state , actively seeking out new sorts of evidence , conducting experiments and developing new technical vocabulary as they settle into a new and better theory . one of g&m 's strong claims is that the standard adult theory ( the so-called \" folk-physics \" and \" folk-psychology \" , e . g . ) is in principle open to revision ; it was developed in response to inadequate child theories of the world , and , as with all scientific theories , it too will be revised , if the need arises . the second chapter in this section compares the theory theory to two other prominent cognitive models , modularity and empirical generalizations ( e . g . , scripts , connectionism ) . g&m do not present the theory theory as a substitute for either of these models completely but as taking over some roles from each . thus , with respect to modularity , the theory theory accounts well for many central cognitive processes and some of the less perceptually oriented modular processes ; with respect to empirical generalizations , the theory theory is better equipped to deal with things like causal linkages and can provide a deeper level of explanation in general , but such generalizations may still form an important basis for the creation of theories . part 2 : evidence for the theory theory part 2 consists of three chapters which each take on a different knowledge domain and show how the theory theory can explain children 's development in these areas . chapter 4 deals with children 's theories of appearances and addresses children 's development with respect to object permanence . chapter 5 takes on children 's theories of action and causality with animate and inanimate things . chapter 5 addresses children 's developing theories of natural kinds . each chapter discusses what the adult theory in each of these domains looks like and then marshals experimental evidence that demonstrates what the infant 's initial theory looks like and what subsequent revisions to their theory the children make . in each domain , they argue that children make crucial theory changes around the ages of 9 months and again around the age of 18 months . g&m report the results from many experiments ( a large number of them conducted by g and / or m themselves ) which amply illustrate that children 's competence in these domains changes ( and improves ) with age . this experimental evidence is at times augmented with anecdotal accounts of how infants affectively interact with different tasks at different ages . g&m are looking for scientific behavior from these children and it is therefore important not only that children can pass more tasks as they get older ( and their theories get better ) but that they view the tasks differently as they get older . they point to examples of emotional consternation that infants show around the time that their theories are putatively changing . thus , a 15 month old will fail to find an object that has been secretly moved to a new hiding place but will be unperturbed by her failure ; a 21 month old will find the object in the new place but will be unimpressed by her own success . an 18 month old , however , is both deeply disturbed when she fails ( and by the structure of the task as a whole ) but is joyful with success . g&m argue that such affective differences reflect something like the blase-ness of normal science compared to the eureka moments that mark a theory in change . with respect to linguistics , one of the claims from these chapters is that early utterances may correspond to technical vocabulary of newly formed theories . g&m 's arguments are particularly intriguing with respect to performative utterances , such as \" gone \" and \" uhoh \" which are quite frequent in the speech of 18 month olds but have been largely ignored in language acquisition studies . they claim that , for example , the emergence of the word \" gone \" in child speech is closely linked with children 's ability to solve an invisible displacement task ( when an object is secretly moved to a new hiding place ) . \" gone \" indicates an object that is out of sight for any reason , and it is in effect a technical term , reflecting a concept in the infant 's new theory . part 3 : language and thought in the previous chapters , the kinds of evidence that g&m suggested were driving theory formation and revision arose primarily from children 's interactions with objects , actions and people in the world . in this chapter , g&m note that language itself is part of the child 's world and different languages could in principle provide different kinds of evidence . since the children 's theories are not innately given but are presumed to be constructed on the basis of the evidence they get from the world , different kinds of linguistic evidence could lead to different theories , or at least to different rates of theory formation . they find support for the effects of language in theory building in a series of longitudinal , crosslinguistic studies looking at children acquiring korean and english . they do not cover the experiments in detail , but the gist of them appears to be that korean is more verb-centric while english is more noun-centric and this linguistic difference translates into korean children developing their theories of action more quickly than their english counterparts , who for their turn , develop their theories of natural kinds more quickly than the korean children . evaluation despite the fact that the theory theory informs an active psychological research program , this book is primarily a book of philosophy . thus , the results from a large number of experimental investigations are discussed but no one experiment is discussed in sufficient detail to be critically evaluated . any reader not already well acquainted with the cognitive developmental literature may find themselves somewhat confused ( and perhaps somewhat unconvinced ) about how g&m are able to draw the conclusions that they do from the experiments reported . this problem might have been remedied to some extent by detailed explanations of one or two experiments that could act as representative examples and the use of diagrams depicting the sorts of tasks used to test infants . a few more diagrams and / or summary tables would have been helpful in general . the theory theory is dynamic in form and g&m trace two or three theory changes within three different knowledge domains . the critical point about theory change comes through clearly , but many of the details get lost in the mass of information ; a summary table describing the different theories ( and perhaps the evidence that leads to theory revision ) would have been a useful reference . although g&m devote an entire chapter to persuading the reader that infant theory development and scientific theory development are the same , ultimately this argument remains unconvincing and the insistence on this point throughout the book has the effect of lessening the force of their claims , rather than strengthening them . there are many reasons to be skeptical of the link between the two sets of theory builders but i think the most compelling reason to reject their argument is that it seems to do a grave injustice to the entrenchment of our folk-scientific reasoning . in a nutshell , our adult folk-science is a stable level of knowledge and may not , even in principle , be subject to revision . g&m try to argue against this powerful intuition in two ways . first , they point to the fact that science has moved beyond our folk theories , so those theories can't be the last word in what is true . while i agree that einsteinian physics is probably more true ( i . e . , a better model of the world ) than my own folk-physics , i ' m still stuck with my inadequate theory . g&m appeal to the division of knowledge-labor to claim that the theory really has changed at a societal level , but that only highlights the fact that for the common person , our folk-science is unrevisable . g&m 's second argument that our folk-science is open to revision is that we can imagine a world that would require a different theory , and they frequently invoke the tv show star trek as illustrating such a world . this fantasy argument leaves me entirely cold , partially because i have no strong intuitions ( as g&m seem to ) about , for example , the status of objects in a star trek transporter beam , and partially because i believe that they are placing far to heavy a burden on a piece of popular fiction . it should be noted , however , that rejecting the most extreme of g&m 's claims does not fundamentally undermine their arguments that knowledge is organized around theories and that developmental change reflects changes in children 's theories . even if children 's theories are not of the same type as scientific theories , analyzing our knowledge in terms of some kind of theory and children 's development as some form of theory change is still a very intriguing and compelling perspective to take . in sum , g&m have raised a number of extremely interesting questions about the nature of knowledge representation , the nature of theories , the nature of cognitive development and the relationship of language to cognitive development . they offer the theory theory as a way to address these questions and , although one might not believe that the theory theory actually has the answers , it is certainly an important view in the debate . reviewed by laura wagner , department of psychology , university of massachusetts - amherst . my research centers on children 's acquisition of tense and aspect .",

( 2 ) are there any examples where the derivation is in the other direction , ie . where a size adjective , eg . \" little \" is derived from a quantifier , eg . \" a few \" ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the above query triggered numerous interesting responses , for which i am grateful to the following residents of the global virtual village : robert beard , steven berbeco , jonathan david bobaljik , john cowan , jane edwards , f . gladney , arthur holmer , knut lambrecht , pierre larrivee , ann lindvall , edith moravcsik , geoffrey s . nathan , chris pountain , ines shaw , nancy stenson , frits stuurman , cynthia vakareliyska , 0ystein alexander vangsnes , peansiri vongvipanond , and a person who wished to remain anonymous . in a nutshell , all of the responses but one provided data from european languages . i do not know enough to say whether this areal patterning is of the phenomenon in question , or rather of the respondents to the query , and the languages that they are familiar with . however , the data suggested that formal relationships between quantifiers and size adjectives are indeed widespread , and provided an affirmative answer to the first specific query , with examples of the derivation of \" many \" from \" big \" . in what follows , i provide a selection of typical responses ( if anybody wants the responses in their entirety , they can contact me directly ) . some more examples of \" little \" > \" a little \" : swedish : liten > lite \" little \" \" a little \" irish : beag > beaga ' n \" little \" \" a little \" french : petit > un petit \" little \" \" a little \" russian : mal / malo / mala > malo \" little \" \" a little \" ( short predicate forms ) polish : maly > malo \" little \" \" a little \" bulgarian : maluk / malko / malka > malko \" little \" \" a little \" some respondents offered interesting diachronic comments : \" [ t ] he latin adjectives for ' little ' , parvus and paulus , were replaced by what is often seen as an ' onomatopoeic ' creation ( * pittinnus for spanish ) . the adverb parum , which is morphologically related to parvus is replaced by a form * paucu , which existed in classical latin only in the plural ( pauci ) with the meaning ' ( a ) few ' . in the medieval romance languages , old spanish _ poco _ , old catalan _ poc _ and old occitan _ pauc _ are however attested in the meaning of ' little ' . \" [ chris pountain ] \" [ t ] he latin root is from ie * pou / pau , which gives english few , foal , as well as latin ( and english ) pauper , poverty , not to mention greek paed ` child ' ( paediatrician etc . ) so all the ` small ' and ` few ' meanings are intermingled throughout all the ie etyma . \" [ geoffrey s . nathan ] and now , in response to question ( 1 ) , some examples of \" big \" > \" many \" : quebec french : gros > gros gros \" big \" \" a lot \" irish : mo ' r > mo ' ra ' n \" big \" \" a lot \" ( negative polarity ) polish : duzy > duzo \" big \" \" a lot \" and a general diachronic comment : \" slavic _ comparative _ quantifier \" more \" has the same root ( bol - ) as adj \" big \" ( old church slavonic bolii , modern russian bol 's hoj ) . \" many / much \" is mnogo / mnogi in the slavic languages , root * minog - ( short i ) - - there 's no etymologically related adj meaning \" big \" . ( the root in the comparative shows up as * bolj - in the comparative quantifier and adjs , but i am assuming the j is a suffix [ . . . ] . i think russian is the only modern language where this root still shows up in the adj . \" big \" , though all of them except modern bulgarian ( and probably macedonian ) still have the comparative quantifier in bol . vasmer 's etymological dictionary of the russian language relates the root to sanskrit baliyan ( acute accent on first a , long mark over i and second a ) , \" stronger \" , balisthas ( acute over first a , dot under first s and t ) , \" strongest \" , \" balam \" ( acute over first a ) \" strength \" . russian has two different comparative forms with this root in addition to the adj \" big \" ( bol 's hoj ) : comparative quantifier bol 's he ( as in \" more money \" ) and adverb bolee ( as in \" more interesting \" ) . \" [ cynthia vakareliyska ] as for question ( 2 ) , pertaining to derivations in the opposite direction ( from quantifier to size adjective ) , here the evidence is still less clear . one respondent [ ann lindvall ] suggested some possible examples from swedish and greek . in fact , in the above slavic examples , the directionality is not immediately clear , and may perhaps be most appropriately characterized as a nondirectional identity of ( neuter-form ) adjective and quantifier . however , i still have n't encountered any uncontroversial examples of size adjectives that are derived from quantifiers . finally , two interesting comments on related phenomena : \" hungarian : ' a little ' or 's omewhat ' ( such as in \" she is a little late . \" or \" a somewhat over-ripe pear was lying on the table . \" ) : _ kicsit _ , which consists of _ kicsi _ ( predicative form of the the adjective for 's mall ' ) plus _ t _ , the accusative marker ' very ' , ' extremely ' ( such as in the above sentences , with \" little \" / \" somewhat \" replaced with \" very \" / \" extremely \" ) : _ nagyon _ , which consists of _ nagy _ ' big ' and _ on _ , a de - adjectival adverbializer . these are ad-verbal and ad-adjectival quantifiers . adnominal quantifiers such as ' many ' and ' few ' do not have to do with size adjectives . \" [ edith moravcsik ] \" i suspect that the thai and lao adverb ( ? ) nak \" great deal , a lot \" and the adjective nak \" heavy \" are derivatives of one another ( strange ? ) through grammaticalization . this verbal quantifier is more prevalent in lao , lanna thai dialect and isan dialect ( all geographically and historically related ) than in bangkok thai . \" [ peansiri vongvipanond ]",
